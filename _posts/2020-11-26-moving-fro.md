Earlier this year, Google informed us that they were going to begin charging for reCAPTCHA.

We liked a number of things about the [hCaptcha](https://www.hcaptcha.com/) solutions:

1) they don't sell personal data; they collect only minimum necessary personal data, they are transparent in describing the info they collect and how they use and/or disclose it, and they agreed to only use such data to provide the hCaptcha service to Cloudflare.
2) performance (both in speed and solve rates) was as good as or better than expected during our A/B testing.
3) it has a robust solution for visually impaired and other users with accessibility challenges.
4) it supported Privacy Pass to reduce the frequency of CAPTCHAs; 5) it worked in regions where Google was blocked; and 6) the hCaptcha team was nimble and responsive in a way that was refreshing.
