Is an add-in for Visual Studio that adds functionality to the Linq-to-SQL / DBML diagram designer, and to the ADO.NET Entity Framework designer in Visual Studio 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2013.

Huagati DBML/EDMX Tools integrates with Visual Studio and adds useful new functionality to the built-in designers for Linq-to-SQL and Entity Framework in Visual Studio. Among the features added to Visual Studio by the add-in are: synchronize your Linq-to-SQL models with the underlying database and any database schema changes, compare and synchronize database, SSDL, and CSDL model in Entity Framework 4 models (VS2010/VS2012/VS2013), mass-rename Linq-to-SQL and Entity Framework generated entity classes and their members to use .net naming conventions, generate documentation comments for L2S and EF entity classes from the database, generate SQL-DDL scripts from Linq-to-SQL and Entity Framework models.	 	

> "One shortcoming of the Visual Studio LINQ to SQL designer is that there is no mechanism to update the object model to reflect the latest database changes."

> "This shortcoming is a non-issue with the Huagati DBML/EDMX Tools, ..."
