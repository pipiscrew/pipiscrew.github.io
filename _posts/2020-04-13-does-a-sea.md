If phages do get into our tissues, what—if anything—do they do there? Only a few studies address the issue. In 2004, researchers led by Dąbrowska reported that a specific type of phage can bind the membrane of cancer cells, reducing tumor growth and spread in mice. A few years later,  Dąbrowska's graduate adviser, phage expert Andrzej Gorski, showed that phages can affect the mouse immune system when injected, ramping down T-cell proliferation and antibody production. In mice, they can even prevent the immune system from attacking transplanted tissues.
