MVC was necessary in the beginning because our front end applications were getting bigger and more complex, and we didn’t know how to structure them. I think it served its purpose, while also providing a good lesson about taking a good practice from one context (the server) and applying it to another (the client).

**So what does the future hold?**
I don’t think that we will come back to the classic MVC architecture anytime soon for our front end apps.
