It does appear that anti-cancer effects have been discovered in research in both Fenbendazole [0][1][2], the treatment that he used, as well as related anti-helmintics like Flubendazole [3], specifically when paired with certain vitamins like Vitamin E rather than when administered alone.
Flubendazole’s particularly interesting as it’s already FDA-approved for human use.
