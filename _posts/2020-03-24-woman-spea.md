https://youtu.be/m0EwquC6wBU Shaetlan (or Shetlandic) is a dialect of Scots (not Scottish Gaelic). The Scots language is closely related to English, and Shaetlan is spoken in the Shetland isles between Scotland and Norway. At first it sounds like she's speaking English with an lilting accent; then the shrooms kick in.
