Is a novel VPN-based app that enables you to speed test all your apps' network performance.
It further gives you several advanced features (all in free and without any advertisements):
- Know which apps in your phone send network traffic in the background;
- Capture the server domains of each app (you may figure out which apps send a lot of Ad traffic);
- Compare similar apps' network performance, and select the one that has better performance;
- Understand which apps encounter network failures through our "Error Logs" setting menu;
- Figure out network-unfriendly apps that keep sending network traffic, which consumes your battery.
