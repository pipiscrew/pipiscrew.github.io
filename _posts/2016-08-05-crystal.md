Is a programming language with the following goals:

-Have a syntax similar to Ruby (but compatibility with it is not a goal)
-Statically type-checked but without having to specify the type of variables or method arguments.
-Be able to call C code by writing bindings to it in Crystal.
-Have compile-time evaluation and generation of code, to avoid boilerplate code.
-Compile to efficient native code.
