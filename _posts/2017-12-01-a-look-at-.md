Mentioned a few times for my love of Arch Linux and Manjaro, but there is another player in the mix that deserves due diligence, and has actually won over my personal use vote as well; Antergos.

https://www.ghacks.net/2017/11/11/a-look-at-arch-linux-based-antergos/

The main difference between Antergos and Manjaro is updates and repositories. Manjaro holds updates for further testing, Antergos does not, and Antergos uses the Arch repos directly.

That said, when you are finished installing Antergos, you are essentially left with an Arch Linux system that has a few extra bells and whistles installed, where as Manjaro is Manjaro, based on Arch. This is over-simplifying, but the essential core difference.

## No internet in live USB installation

## Use debtap to install Deb Package in Arch Linux (only for x64)

*1* https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/debtap/ or https://github.com/helixarch/debtap
```js
install #debtap#
use : debtap package.deb
creates package.pkg.tar.xz
where can installed by 
 sudo packman -U package.pkg.tar.xz
```

*2*gdebi is just a front-end to the dpkg with added functionality that it can check for dependency packages

## Archlinux two repositories

Official repository - https://www.archlinux.org/packages
The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community-driven repository for Arch users. - https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/

## Search for a package on all distros

## Install yaourt guide

The Arch User Repository (AUR) is a community-driven repository for Arch users. It contains package descriptions (PKGBUILDs) that allow you to compile a package from source with makepkg and then install it via pacman. ref - https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_User_Repository

Yaourt is a command line interface program which complete pacman for installing software on Archlinux. By default is not installed.
*1* install git
```js
//https://stackoverflow.com/a/40386256/1320686
sudo pacman -S git
```
*2* follow the instructions at yaourt homepage - https://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en
*3*
```jsyaourt wine //lists all the package contain wine
yaourt wine-stable //installs the package wine-stable```

## Create your own gpg key database for your local user

```jsgpg --full-gen-key```

## Use other tmp dir for yaourt because is restricted

```js
//https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Tmpfs
//https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/issues/47
sudo mkdir /tmp2
sudo chmod 777 /tmp2

yaourt wps-office --tmp /tmp2
```

```js
//for KDE - Dolphin to enable show hidden files use once
Alt + .

//for KDE - show desktop shortcut -- https://docs.kde.org/trunk5/en/applications/fundamentals/kbd.html
Ctrl + F12

//get cmd help
man yaourt

//see free space
df -h
df -hi

//see&kill running processes for all users
ps -aux
kill pid_no

//lists installed packages
pacman -Q or use pacman -Q > pacman.txt to export to txt

//uninstall package and dependencies -- https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=96523
pacman -Rsn package_name

//disable makepkg skippgpcheck skipchecksums - https://github.com/archlinuxfr/yaourt/issues/108
yaourt --m-arg "--skipchecksums --skippgpcheck" -Sb package
equivalent with makepkg --skipchecksums --skippgpcheck

//download package locally and install it via :
pacman -U /root/Download/packagename.tar.gz

//in case you get error: 'package.tar.gz': invalid or corrupted package
//possibly is AUR package, you have to extract it, goto directory and build via :
makepkg or makepkg -s (to resolve the dependencies)
//then install the result package with :
pacman -U package.tar.gz

//special dir 
/usr/lib/systemd/system/
/usr/bin
/usr/local
/bin
```

## Build a PKGBUILD file

1-create a folder, copy the PKGBUILD file
2-open terminal to this folder run ```js//https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PKGBUILD 
makepkg``` to resolve automatically the dependencies ```jsmakepkg -s```

## Installing LTS kernel

```js
//kernel version
uname -r

//install linux-lts - more https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-H3jURTgqk
sudo pacman -S linux-lts

//update your bootloader, if you use GRUB run this command:
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

*restart the machine*

//after the restart, you should see the GRUB menu
go to the Advanced options, and select to boot with the *LTS kernel*

//check the kernel version and make sure it is an LTS version
uname -r

//remove the latest kernel and keep only the LTS kernel
sudo pacman -R linux

ps if you keep both kernels, Arch Linux will use the latest kernel by default after you reboot your system. 
```

## WineHQ

Search a package - https://www.archlinux.org/packages
