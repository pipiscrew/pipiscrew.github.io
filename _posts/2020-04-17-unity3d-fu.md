Hot reloading is the development focus of KSFramework-on the premise of not restarting the game, the reloading code and configuration table can immediately see the modification effect, maximize the speed of development and debugging, and facilitate the hot update during the operation phase.

For programmers, you can use AssetBundle to load and package, scripted UI, automatic configuration table code generation, download and update basic functional modules, which greatly reduces the workload of basic functions around the game.
