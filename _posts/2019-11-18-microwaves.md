A microwave oven operates at a frequency 2.45 GHz. **Percy Lebaron** the inventor of the microwave oven, **found out** that microwaves **can also cook food by accident**. He found that a candy bar that he carried in his pocket was melted by radar waves.  ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percy_Spencer))

A microwave oven cooks food because the **water molecules inside food** absorb the **microwave radiation** and thereby heat up and heat the surrounding food. Microwave radiation will similarly heat up skin and other body parts. Heat transfer could explain why one sometimes hears about people working at fast-food workers etc. getting **headaches** when exposed to leaking microwave ovens. (Chad Mueller)

Microwave ovens cook food by generating **intermolecular friction** between the molecules of the food. The microwaves cause water molecules to vibrate; the **increased friction** between the **molecules** **results** in **heat**. Microwaves could affect your tissue in a similar way if they **were able to escape** from the microwave oven. (David E. Hintenlang)

A Swiss food scientist (Hans Hertel) in the late 1980s found that microwaved food increased cholesterol levels, decreased red and white blood cell counts, decreased hemoglobin and produced radiolytic compounds. Hertel and seven fellow vegetarians locked themselves into a hotel room, where they performed a **two-month experiment** that consisted of eating foods prepared in the microwave and by other means. After two months of togetherness, Hertel emerged with a terrifying pronouncement: He had found changes that

in the **blood of the men** who had eaten microwaved milk and vegetables. ([src](http://www.openmediacoalition.it/documenti/echr-case-of-hertel-v-switzerland/index.html))   ([src2](https://yourmedicalsource.com/content/microwaved-food-dangerous-myths-and-facts))

Studies suggest microwaving your food could expose you to **carcinogenic toxins** released **by** plastic or paper **wrappers**.

The most **heat-sensitive nutrients** are **water-soluble vitamins**, like **folic acid** and vitamins B and C, which are common in vegetables.

Vitamins are generally classed as either **water-soluble** or **fat-soluble**. The **water-soluble** vitamins generally act as **precursors** to **coenzymes**.

In studies at Cornell University, scientists looked at the effects of cooking on **water-soluble** vitamins in vegetables and found that **spinach** retained nearly all its **folate** when cooked in a microwave, **but lost** about **77 percent** when **cooked** on a **stove**. They also found that **bacon** cooked by microwave has significantly **lower** levels of cancer-causing nitrosamines **than conventionally cooked** bacon.

When it comes to vegetables, <span style="color: #ff0000;">**adding water**</span> can greatly **accelerate the loss** of nutrients. One study published in The Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture in 2003 found that broccoli cooked by microwave — and immersed in water — **loses** about 74 percent to 97 percent of its antioxidants. When **steamed** or **cooked** without water, the broccoli **retained** most of its **nutrients**. ([src](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/health/17real.html)) ([mirror](http://docdroid.net/XqdTH6U))

> Microwave ovens generally do not destroy nutrients in food. Every cooking method can destroy vitamins and other nutrients in food. The factors that determine the extent are how long the food is cooked, how much liquid is used and the cooking temperature.

Dr Garcia-Viguera said this is because the antioxidants are water-soluble. "During microwave heating they **leach into the cooking water**, removing their nutritional benefits from the foodstuff."

###  What the microwave oven does to the food:

➜ Breaks chemical and molecular bonds
➜ The food molecules are destroyed and deformed by microwave’s radiation, thus resulting in harmful radioactive compounds.
➜ 96% of the breast milk antibodies are destroyed by microwaving.
➜ The structure of Infant formulas is altered by microwaving. Namely, it changes the components in amino acids, thus resulting in immunological abnormalities.
➜ A 1992 Search for Health’s study examined the effects of participants who consumed micro-waved vegetables. In addition, the participants reported:

➜ Rapidly elevated cholesterol levels ➜ Reduced hemoglobin, leading to an anemic-like conditions ➜ Reduced white blood cells ➜ Elevated leukocytes, showing poisoning and cell damage.

You are **still exposed** to **dangerous levels** of **electromagnetic fields** (EMF) even in case your microwave oven is ideally sealed. What’s more, EMF can actually **enter into human bodies** and lead to serious health issues as :

➜ Cataracts (since there is a lack of blood vessels in our eyes to dissipate the microwave’s heat and cellular stress)
➜ Viral and bacterial infection decreased resistance
➜ Weakened immune system
➜ Birth defects
➜ Cancer
➜ Other serious illnesses

Limited exposure to EMF of 0.5mG – 2.5mG is recommended by the EPA (USA **E**nvironmental **P**rotection **A**gency).

So in case you stand 10cm from a microwave that is operating, then you will be exposed to 100 – 500mG.
On the other hand, if you stand 3 feet away from your microwave that is operating, you will be exposed to 1 – 25mG. ([src](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlO1kbkAUfo))
