Use any desktop OS without leaving a trace. Imagine you're entering a country at the airport. The border agents seize your laptop and force you to unlock it so that they can violate your privacy, treat you like a criminal, and insult your humanity. Is that the world you want to live in?

Whether you use Windows, macOS or Linux, now there's a tech solution for better privacy: HiddenVM.

HiddenVM is a simple, one-click, free and open-source Linux application that allows you to run Oracle's open-source VirtualBox software on the Tails operating system.
