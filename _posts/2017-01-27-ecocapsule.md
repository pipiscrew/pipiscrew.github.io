This innovative tiny home, dubbed an Ecocapsule, will enable millions to comfortably live off the grid anywhere in the world, be it the middle of nowhere, a destination beach, or even a rooftop. The Ecocapsule is being designed by Nice Architects, an architectural team based in Bratislava, Slovakia. The home includes a bed that can sleet two, a toilet, dining area, and even a kitchenette.
