Other games that will be arriving as part of the Arcade Archives include Super Mario Bros., Balloon Fight, Ice Climbers, Clu Clu Land, Punch-Out, and Pinball.

Nintendo has capitalized on fan nostalgia before, such as with its Wii U Virtual Console and more recently its NES and SNES Classic consoles. The Arcade Archives, though, will be ports of old cabinet games, so they will differ from the NES versions of the games.
