Creating a new user. Go to Configuration > Manage local users then Add. Put in the following:

Username: username
Personal Name: personalname@localhost
Mail Password:[same password you'll enter in thunderbird]

Then in Thunderbird, created an account using the following credentials:

 Your name: username
 Email Address: username@localhost
 password:[password set up in mercury mail]
 Server Type: POP3

edited my php.ini file, search for sendmail_from and removed the semi-column (;)

That’s it! But for this to work you have to restart your XAMPP. Once they’re back on (Apache, MySQL, and Mercury Mail) run your PHP script, this is how mine looks like:

```js
//test
<?php $recipient="username@localhost" ;="" $subject="Test Email" ;="" $mail_body="Nobody is going to get this email but me." ;="" mail($recipient,="" $subject,="" $mail_body);=""?>
```

maybe you will get

> SMTP server response: 553 We do not relay non-local mail, sorry.

solution - @ MercurySMTP Settings @ Connection Control Tab > Uncheck Donot Permit SMTP relaying on non-local mail, illustrated :
