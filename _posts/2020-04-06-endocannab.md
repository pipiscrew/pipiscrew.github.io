**Cannabinoid** there are at least 113 different cannabinoids. Cannabinoids in cannabis plants accounts for up to 40% of the plant's extract. Will focus on three of them :

THC - is the phytocannabinoid tetrahydrocannabinol the most notable cannabinoid.

CBD - is the **phytocannabinoid** known as cannabidiol (CBD) . .

CBN - comes from stale cannabis and the breakdown of THC molecules, could be the most [sedative](https://www.steephill.com/blogs/34/Cannabinol-(CBD):-A-Sleeping-Synergy) of all cannabinoids. [more](https://www.analyticalcannabis.com/articles/beyond-cbd-exploring-the-health-benefits-of-cbn-311488)

The **body endocannabinoid system** (ECS) not only helps us to benefits from CBD products but **regulates** vital aspects of our biology and is critical for overall health. The endocannabinoid system is critical for helping **to maintain homeostasis, helping cells perform at their best**.

There are **three critical components** found in the endocannabinoid system (ECS) :

➜ **Endocannabinoids (eCBs)**

**Neurotransmitters** like serotonin and dopamine are **chemical** messengers of the **nervous** system. Also called **endogenous** cannabinoids, actually are **molecules** made by your **body**. They’re **similar** to **cannabinoids**, but they’re **produced** by your **body**. Experts have identified **two** key endocannabinoids so far:

*   anandamide (AEA) – (involved with appetite, memory, and pregnancy etc) [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anandamide)

*   2-arachidonoylglyerol (2-AG) – (linked to our emotional states, protection from seizures, and maintaining cardiovascular health. That contented feeling you experience after orgasm)

Just like the **phytocannabinoids** in cannabis, these neurotransmitters are built from **lipids** (fats or oils).These help keep **internal** functions running **smoothly**. Your **body produces** them as **needed**, making it difficult to know what typical levels are for each.

➜ **Cannabinoid Receptors (CB receptors)**

Sit on cell surfaces, waiting for specific **neurotransmitters** to **bind** to them. There are two essential cannabinoid **receptors** :

*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">CB1</span> are essential for a **healthy functioning brain** and are one of the **most** common receptors in the **entire nervous** Depending on what **region** of the **brain** they are **located** in, they can be **moderators** of your :

    *   memory

    *   mood

    *   motor function

    *   perception of pain

These brain receptors are also responsible for the **psychoactive properties**  when **THC binds** to them. Also have roles in :

*   pregnancy

*   hormone production

*   cardiovascular health

*   digestion

*   <span style="color: #ff0000;">CB2</span> are most often found on the cells of our **immune** They help **moderate inflammation** and our immune **response** to **pathogens**. Have roles to defeat :

    *   arthritis

    *   asthma

    *   allergies

    *   autoimmune disorders

    *   digestive issues (like inflammatory bowel disease)

Both receptors can **travel** throughout the whole **body**. Most **cannabinoids** can **bind** to both **types** of receptors — CB1 & CB2. This is true for both the endocannabinoids (AEA & 2-AG)  and for phytocannabinoids (CBD + THC).

CBD has very **little binding** affinity with the receptors, and yet scientists have observed that its administration **leads** to increased endocannabinoid **anandamide** levels. Known as the "bliss molecule" anandamide plays a role in the **neural generation** of pleasure and motivation. It also performs other **important functions** like regulating feeding behaviors and assisting with embryo implantation during the early stages of pregnancy. Scientists realized that CBD **inhibits** the **FAAH enzyme** responsible for **breaking** down **anandamide** in the body. **Less** FAAH means **more** anandamide **stays** in the **body** for longer. This is backed up by research including a [small pilot study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21307846) on subjects with social anxiety that showed CBD <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">could **reduce** feelings of **discomfort** and **cognitive** impairment during a simulated public speaking test</span>.

➜ **Enzymes: Building & Recycling eCBs  (Metabolic enzymes)**

So far we’ve discussed the messengers and the message-receivers, but **who** makes the **messenger**? Endocannabinoids are lipid-based neurotransmitters — which means they are **synthesized** from **fats**. Your body has a number of **different enzymes** that work together to **transform fatty substances** into anandamide and 2-AG. When your body gets the **signal** to **produce** eCBs, these **enzymes** are put to work.

Then when sending the message, cannabinoids are **fat-soluble**, but your body is mostly **composed** of **water**. In order for cannabinoids to **travel** through your **body** and reach their targets, they need to be escorted by **endocannabinoid transport proteins**.

Every “on” switch needs a corresponding “off” switch. Once anandamide and 2-AG have **delivered** their **messages**, the body needs a way to **prevent** them from continuing to stimulate the ECS **indefinitely**. eCBs are rapidly moved by transport **proteins** to storage sites and/or delivered to enzymes that **degrade** eCBs.

The two most-studied enzymes in the ECS are :

*   FAAH (which degrades anandamide)

*   MAGL (which breaks down 2-AG)

**FAAH** is especially **interesting**: A genetic variation in **20%** of adults **impairs** their FAAH **enzyme** — and the result is that these people have **increased** levels of **anandamide** and are generally [less anxious](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7395). Because CBD [inhibits these enzymes](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13311-015-0374-6) it tends to **increase** the body’s levels of feel-good anandamide and 2-AG.

One important thing we’ve learned about this process: increasing your dietary intake of **omega-3s** and other essential **fatty acids** may help your body boost its **production** of **eCBs**, because these fatty acids are specific building blocks for eCBs.

The **cannabinoids** and <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">**terpenes**</span> (τερπένια) in the cannabis plant interact with our bodies in **synergy**. For instance, the **terpene Myrcene** is able to **reduce** the <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">**blood-brain barrier**</span> ([read more](https://www.pipiscrew.com/2020/03/blood-brain-barrier-bbb-ematoegkefalikos-fragmos-explained/)), allowing cannabinoids to **pass through** with ease; terpenes limonene and linalool work together to combat acne.

**Terpenes** are the **fragrant oils** found in many types of **plants** and produce a unique **taste** and **smell**. The strong aromas produced by the cannabis flower are one of the plant’s most recognizable or **trademark** characteristics. Terpenes are found in various quantities and combinations among all varieties of :

*   fruits

*   veggies

*   trees

*   flowers

*   herbs

*   plants

Although there are **hundreds** of different terpenes, found in the seemingly endless **varieties** of cannabis, these **five** are the most prevalent :

*   Myrcene

*   Pinene (accounts for over half of its aromatic properties)

*   Limonene

*   Linalool

*   Caryophyllene

Terpenes, or **isoprenoids**, provide cannabis with its unique **bouquet**. The **molecules** are quite small and consist of repeating units of a compound called **isoprene**. Although less well-known than the major cannabinoids, terpenes are instrumental to the **physiological** and **psychoactive** effects of cannabis. The relationship between **terpenes** and **cannabinoids**, known as the “entourage effect,” ultimately differentiates one strain of cannabis from another.

Terpenes play a vital **role** in the **plant** kingdom; they deter insect predation, **protect** plants from environmental **stresses**, and act as building **blocks** for more complex **molecules**, such as **cannabinoids**. Many terpenes act synergistically with other varieties of terpenes, and some either catalyze or inhibit **formation** of different compounds within a plant. Understanding how terpenes function allows scientists to manipulate cannabinoids to desired ratios.
