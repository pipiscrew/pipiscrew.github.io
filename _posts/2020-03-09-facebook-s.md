Facebook alleged to have committed serious breaches with data collected by This is Your Digital Life app used by Cambridge Analytica for political profiling. Australiaâ€™s information commissioner is suing Facebook over allegedly breaching the privacy of over 300,000 Australians caught up in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. At the time, Facebook said 311,127 Australians between March 2014 and May 2015 had data shared with the app, accounting for 0.4% of users affected by the breach.

However, the court documents reveal just 53 people in Australia installed the app.
