Long have humans wondered where it all started. The world, the stars, all the plants, animals, other planets. How could all of that come from nothing? How could something as complex as the brain or the human eye just come into existence? It's a very human trait to be asking all these questions and spiritual groups from all over the world have been grappling with the origin stories for as long as everyone else.

It's not just religious groups anymore though. Western scientists such as Nikola Tesla also studied the universe. In a famous Tesla quote, he said that the very foundations of the universe, matter, and thought, lie in sound vibration. The quote being this; “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency, and vibration.”

The sound OM is widely known. From yoga classes to a relaxing music CD or maybe even a movie, most people have heard OM in one form or another. OM is a Sanskrit syllable and has become commonplace in yogis and anyone interested in eastern spirituality alike. The real meaning behind the syllable is known by very few though.

This strange ancient Sanskrit letter was first found in the Vedas, which has been determined to originate between 1500 – 1200 BC. OM is more about the sound vibration it produces rather than the meaning behind it.
