Overall, women and men aged 50 could **expect to live another 30 to 40 years**, and 75% to 84% of that time would be free of the diseases studied.

However, women and men with healthy lifestyles could expect to live longer, healthier lives. They were less likely to be diagnosed with cancer, cardiovascular disease or diabetes, and if they did get these diseases, they survived for longer after diagnosis.

The study estimates that for people aged 50:
-women with 4 or 5 healthy lifestyle habits can expect to live another 41.1 years, 34.4 years of which would be free of disease
-women with no healthy lifestyle habits can expect to live another 31.7 years, 23.7 of which would be free of disease
-men with 4 or 5 healthy lifestyle habits can expect to live another 39.4 years, 31.2 of which would be free of disease
-men with no healthy lifestyle habits can expect to live another 31.3 years, 23.5 of which would be free of disease
