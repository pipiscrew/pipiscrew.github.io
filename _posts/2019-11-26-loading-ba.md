When planning the rollouts of their 5G networks, Taiwan's telecom operators should not focus on factors such as the extended cost for network coverage, but rather on whether the loading and bandwidth capacities of their networks are sufficient to meet market demand, according to Daijun Zhang, president of Samsung R&D Institute China-Beijing (SRC-B).

Taiwan's government plans to release 270MHz in bandwidth in 3.5GHz band and 2,500 MHz in bandwidth in 28GHz band for 5G services, and so it is obvious that the competition for the 270MHz bandwidth in 3.5GHz by five local telecom operators in Taiwan will be fierce, Zhang said.

But as the bandwidth to be available in the 28GHz band is almost 10 times those available in 3.5GHz band, Taiwan's telecom operators had better utilize the high frequency mmWave band ranges available in 2.8GHz spectrum to offer related 5G services, particularly in densely populated urban areas, Zhang urged.
