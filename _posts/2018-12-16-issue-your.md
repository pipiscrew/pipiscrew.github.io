### Creating the certificate with openssl

**
The openssl advise to use the precompiled from the following distributors.  ([proof](https://www.openssl.org/community/binaries.html))
download MinGW compiled from [https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/openssl](https://bintray.com/vszakats/generic/openssl)

**run :**
```js
openssl genrsa -des3 -out ca.key 4096
```

[caption width="775" align="aligncenter"][![](https://i.imgur.com/StVNXoz.png)](https://i.imgur.com/StVNXoz.png) ca.key will generated[/caption]

**run :**
```js
openssl req -new -config openssl.cnf -x509 -days 9999 -key ca.key -out ca.crt
```

[caption width="1057" align="aligncenter"][![](https://i.imgur.com/DgLTTk4.png)](https://i.imgur.com/DgLTTk4.png) we enter our email address^ this will be used to identify the certificate later on outlook.      ca.crt will generated[/caption]

Double click the **ca.crt** 
![](https://i.imgur.com/Kc8Iqve.png)

**run :**
```js
openssl pkcs12 -export -in ca.crt -inkey ca.key -out ca.p12
```
[caption width="877" align="aligncenter"][![](https://i.imgur.com/u57rBpH.png)](https://i.imgur.com/u57rBpH.png) ca.p12 will generated[/caption]

[caption width="171" align="aligncenter"]![](https://i.imgur.com/W5xhi90.png) right click[/caption]

[caption width="933" align="aligncenter"][![](https://i.imgur.com/fD3eFyG.png)](https://i.imgur.com/fD3eFyG.png) [windows + R] > certmgr.msc[/caption]

At **outlook**
File > options > trust center > trust center settings > email security > default setting, settings button > Signing Certificate [choose] > automatically verifies the certificate (we enter before our email address) with the account we have to outlook

**PKCS#12 of .pfx or .p12**

The PKCS#12 or PFX format is a binary format for storing the server certificate, any intermediate certificates, and the private key into a single encryptable file. PFX files are usually found with the extensions .pfx and .p12. PFX files are typically used on Windows machines to import and export certificates and private keys. The Personal Information Exchange format (PFX, also called PKCS #12) supports secure storage of certificates, private keys, and all certificates in a certification path. The PKCS #12 format is the only file format that can be used to export a certificate and its private key.

**.CRT or .CER**

CRT is a file extension for a digital certificate file used with a web browser. CRT files are used to verify a secure websiteâ€™s authenticity, distributed by certificate authority (CA) companies such as GlobalSign, VeriSign and Thawte.
