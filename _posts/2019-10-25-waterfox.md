The Waterfox browser is based on Firefox code but there are notable difference between the two browsers. Waterfox continues to support (some) NPAPI plugins, comes without Telemetry, and bootstrapped add-ons.

Waterfox Classic, is the legacy branch of the web browser that will continue to support older standards. 

Waterfox Current on the other hand will keep up "with the modern web".
