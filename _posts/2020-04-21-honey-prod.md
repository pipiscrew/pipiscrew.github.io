thanks to the plantation of **hundreds of thousands of trees** under Prime Minister Imran Khanâ€™s Billion **Tree project**.

The honey production initiative in Changa Manga was started in 2016 when beehives were auctioned for Rs. **729k**.

Now, their value has risen to over Rs. **1.3 million**.

before :
Locals of the forest describe how ruthless **deforestation**, as well as reduction in the green cover, significantly **reduced** the number of beehives as honeybees found little to **no place to make hives**.

Furthermore, the flowers which honey bees use to collect nectar became **toxic** due to spray of the **pesticides**, resulting in the **deaths** of thousands of bees.
