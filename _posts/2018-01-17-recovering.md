Personally, when I plug an external HDD and not even appears to My Computer and appears to My Computer > Manage, Im using the freeware 
[Abstradrome.Repartition Bad Drive v1.01](http://www.dposoft.net/rbd.html).

articles talking with the best words for [Abstradrome.HDD Regenerator](http://www.dposoft.net/hdd.html) (paid)
