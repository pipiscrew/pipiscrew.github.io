You should always test your websites and applications on a low bandwidth connection, but few people take the time. Many people don't know how to simulate simulate low bandwidth or think it's hard to set up.

### Facebook Slows the Internet for Staffers on ’2G Tuesdays’

Facebook is offering its employees a chance to slow down – but only for an hour.

The social network on Tuesday launched “2G Tuesdays” to let its staffers experience the social network as if on a 2G connection. The idea is to simulate the experience of Facebook users in regions with sluggish networks – a major area of growth for Facebook – who might use the site differently.

However, the experience is so onerous that Facebook only subjects its employees to slow speed internet for an hour. And the program is optional.
