## How to Gmailify your account(s)

Gmailify your own inbox if you own an Android phone by opening up the Gmail app and signing in to your Outlook, Hotmail or Yahoo account. From there follow these simple steps:

-Tap the three bars in the top left of the app to open the menu list.
-Scroll down until you see an option for 'Settings'.
-Tap the Yahoo, Hotmail or Outlook account you wish to link and then tap 'Link Account'.

If you find that all of the Google Now cards and contextual categories are not to your liking, thankfully you can reverse the changes by following the same steps, selecting the linked Gmail account and tapping the 'Unlink' option.
