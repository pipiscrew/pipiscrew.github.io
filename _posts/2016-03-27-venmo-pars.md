In February, mobile payment app Venmo suddenly discontinued its developer API. Well, kind of. Turns out Venmo just cut off new developers – existing developers would still have access. But Venmo may remove features. But maybe not. But also maybe they will.

The now-murky future of the Venmo API arrives on the heels of Facebook’s decision last month to shut down its Parse service, an immensely popular API used by over 600,000 developers. Parse challenged an entire industry’s notion of what the first five minutes of using a mobile SDK could be, and their acquisition by Facebook in 2013 promised a bright future for mobile developers.
