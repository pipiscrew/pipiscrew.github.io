Your car sits idle over [95% of the time](http://www.reinventingparking.org/2013/02/cars-are-parked-95-of-time-lets-check.html).

Your guest bedroom is occupied one week out of every 52.

Your kids use the yard less than [40 minutes a week](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2012/10/04/backyards-overrated-outdoors-indoors/1613815/).

Yet we consumers love to envision the maximum usage for a particular item – like a house or a car – then buy the item with a capacity high enough to accommodate our visions. It makes us feel prepared, it feeds our egos, and it feels as though we got more value for our money than if we’d bought something smaller.

We do this despite knowing that we won’t be boarding guests year ’round, driving groups of eight in our minivan, and hosting lavish backyard parties, nightly.

But rather than buy for peak usage, I prefer to stay flexible.
