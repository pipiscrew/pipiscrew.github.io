A **federal jury** in **San Francisco** awarded more than **$80 million** to 70-year-old California man, Edwin Hardeman, who was diagnosed with cancer after spraying **Monsanto Roundup** Weedkiller on his property for **decades**. Since then, **Costco** has reportedly stopped selling the herbicide. It is expected that many other retailers will follow suit. It's not looking good for the company that owns the Roundup brand. Not looking good whatsoever. [src](https://www.disclose.tv/costco-has-stopped-selling-monsanto-roundup-weedkiller-364484)
