This is Omar from Lizardcube, now based in Paris, France. I am the technical director and programmer for our upcoming game Wonder Boy: The Dragonâ€™s Trap. The game is a remake of a 1989 Sega/Westone cult classic action-adventure early metroidvania-style game for which we acquired a licence from the original developers. It is getting published by DotEmu.
