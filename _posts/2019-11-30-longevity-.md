Imagine that the network of neurons in the brain is engaged in something like the party game Telephone. Each neuron is covered with proteins and molecular channels that enable it to fire and pass messages. When one neuron fires, it releases a flood of neurotransmitters that excite or inhibit the firing of the next neuron down the line.

The REST protein inhibits the production of some of the proteins and channels involved in this process, reining in the excitation.

Long-lived humans have unusually low levels of proteins involved in excitation.
