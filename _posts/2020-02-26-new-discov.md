Science has long thought that multicellular life needed oxygen to survive. It turns out that assumption was wrong as a new DNA information on a parasite has been discovered about a parasite described as jellyfish-like. The parasite lacks the **mitochondrial genome** and is the first known multicellular organism to lack that genome.

**Lacking** the **mitochondrial genome** means that the parasite doesnâ€™t breathe and needs no oxygen to survive. Scientists note that not only does the discovery change how life can work on Earth, it also has implications in the search for **extraterrestrial life**. Scientists say that **life started to metabolize oxygen over 1.45 billion years ago**.
