You are installing an internal network of permanent high-frequency radiation transmitters. To make this even clearer, when you look out of your window, **can you see a cell phone transmission tower on a pole or roof? This is just one. With active Powerline, you have several of these in every room** because each electrical wire is transformed into a radio transmitter.
