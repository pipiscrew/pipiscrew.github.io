Is a powerful and free open source **cross platform** rapid application development environment. With Lazarus you can easily create native applications and deploy them to many platforms. Simply press compile, copy a single program file to a computer, and your application is installed. There are no dependencies. The Lazarus mantra is: write once. compile anywhere.
