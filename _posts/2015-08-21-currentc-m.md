The mobile payments app backed by major retailers, may be delayed until next year.

The app is backed by the consortium known as MCX, a group that includes 7-Eleven, Alon Brands, Best Buy, CVS Health, Darden Restaurants; HMSHost, Hy-Vee, Lowe's, Michaels, Publix, Sears Holdings, Shell Oil Products US, Sunoco, Target Corporation and Walmart. Is very different than apps like Apple Pay (and soon, Samsung Pay and Android Pay) as the app does not allow you to link your credit/debit cards. You can either hook up your checking account, use a store gift card, or attach the retailer's private-label payment cards.
