Is a free browser extension for Google Chrome that you can use to run security scans on files before downloading them.

Metadefender is a popular malware analysis service that scans files that you upload to it against more than 40 different antivirus and threat detection engines.

It works in this regard like Virustotal, but adds a couple of extra options to the process. Apart from the 140 Megabyte per file upload limit -- Virustotal's maximum size for files is set to 128 Megabyte -- it is extracting files and listing all files of the archive.
