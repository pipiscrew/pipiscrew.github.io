If you don’t remember the Commodore Amiga, it was a computer from the late 1980s and early 1990s. It was incredibly popular among gamers and hackers, thanks to its powerful graphics chip.

It was also used in many television stations to create title sequences. It was one of the first systems to do video editing.

Commodore computers can be quite expensive on Ebay. But don’t worry, you can use a Raspberry Pi 3 to emulate Amigas, including the best-selling 500 and the impressive 1200.
