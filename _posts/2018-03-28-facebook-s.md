After news broke that Facebook Messenger and Lite scraped call logs and text history from Android devices, the social network stressed that it didn't do so in secret and with an ulterior motive. It got access to those data due to Android's wonky permission system, and it only inadvertently collected info from users who agreed to give the app access to their contacts list. That explanation, however, wasn't enough for the three users who filed a lawsuit against the social network, accusing it of violating their privacy by collecting their call and text history.
