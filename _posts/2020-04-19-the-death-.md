Carrying a mobile phone with me means that Google knows where I am every day. They know where I work because that’s is where my phone is during the day, they know where I live because I spend the night there, and they know the entertainment joint that I frequent on Saturdays. They know that the place that I go and spend some time every Sunday morning must be where I go to church, and they know the people I met since they see the devices meeting together.

Take the example of the ‘Terms & Conditions’ segments that we encounter on many websites, applications, software and many other digital tools we use. Do we read that text? No. Do the writers of these T&C expect us to read them? No. The documents are usually unnecessarily long, written in the smallest font possible, and using complicated terms which a layperson would likely not understand. We have little option other than checking the ‘Accept’ box. Even when browsing any website, we encounter the notorious pop-up ‘This site uses cookies… Click here to accept,’ and we always accept without a second thought, not knowing what cookies are.
