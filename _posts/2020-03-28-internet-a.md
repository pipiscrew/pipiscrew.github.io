To address our unprecedented global and immediate need for access to reading and research materials, as of today, March 24, 2020, the Internet Archive will suspend waitlists for the 1.4 million (and growing) books in our lending library by creating a National Emergency Library to serve the nationâ€™s displaced learners. This suspension will run through **June 30, 2020**, or the end of the US national emergency, whichever is later.
