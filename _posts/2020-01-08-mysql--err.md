merge these to etc/mysql/my.cnf

```js
// src - https://stackoverflow.com/a/48841413/1320686

[mysqld]
innodb_log_file_size = 32M
innodb_strict_mode = 0
innodb_page_size =64k
innodb_buffer_pool_size=512M
```

ofc you have to restart the mysql server, the con @ you have to recreate the whole dbase!, solution working on docker as well.

* * *

Build docker image from scratch having these settings, add this command to your docker setup
```js
// src - https://stackoverflow.com/a/55826472/1320686

command: ['--innodb_page_size=64k', '--innodb_log_buffer_size=32M', '--innodb_buffer_pool_size=512M']

```
