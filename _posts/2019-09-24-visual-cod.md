> It's strongly suggested to set "remote-workspace-load-all" to false, otherwise the whole project is downloaded every time is opened and can be extremely long. With remote-workspace-load-all files and folders are downloaded on demand.

> To avoid content and folder random deletions WAIT FOR "REMOTE INFO DOWNLOADING SUCCESS" MESSAGE BEFORE BROWSING REMOTE FOLDERS and do not download more than 2-3 folders at a time! This is not 100% risk free, but give it time to load and it'll not delete random things :)
