To use the feature, you’ll need to be on the latest version of the Skype mobile app. Then, you’ll select “Find” on the top bar while in conversation with a friend or family member, and choose the “Send Money” add-in. You just type in the amount to send, confirm the payment, and hit send to complete the transaction.
