Low cost devices not certified by Google are mostly affected.

That's actually the case with hundreds of different smartphones, according to Avast Thread Labs. The researchers found adware installed on devices not certified by Google from manufacturers like ZTE, Archos and myPhone. Users with affected phones will see popup ads and other annoying problems, and because the adware is installed on a firmware level, it's incredibly difficult to remove.

This isn't the first time we've seen bad apps pre-installed, as Lenovo famously shipped the "Superfish" malware with brand new PCs. It's one of the bigger scandals related to malware installed on Android devices, however, and might affect a lot more users.
