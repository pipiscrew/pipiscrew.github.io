Retrogaming Simplified. Computer, 4K-Mediacenter and the Greatest Retro-Station known to Man! Is as simple as plug-and-play and requires no expertise or experience to set up. The system comes with several pre-installed games that work out of the box. Additionally, via an easy smartphone guided setup procedure, gamers gain the ability to run a majority of retro video games released on such classic systems as Atari VCS 2600, Sega Genesis, NES and many more. It is also a living room computer and powerful media-center. Retrogaming simplified!

Is not official, the technical specifications communicated by the development team speak clearly: with its Allwinner H3 processor with four hearts ARM 7 clocked at 1.2 GHz, its graphic heart Mali 400 MP2, its 512 MB RAM and its built-in Wi-Fi, it is clear that the card used is an **Orange Pi Lite**. A Chinese Raspberry Pi clone that costs even less than the latter and which, like it, is capable of running light GNU / Linux systems and therefore emulators.
