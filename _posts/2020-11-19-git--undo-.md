```js
git reflog
# you will see a list of every thing you've
# done in git, across all branches!
# each one has an index HEAD@{index}
# find the one before you broke everything
git reset HEAD@{index}
# magic time machine
```

//set default editor
git config --global core.editor "C:/x/VSCodium/VSCodium.exe"

//list the 10 last commits
git log -10 --pretty=oneline --abbrev-commit

//ask to rebase the two last
//here the editor will appear listing the two last commits and the available options,
//you just need to delete commit line with the editor NOTHING ELSE.
//
//WARNING most recent commit is the one at the #bottom#
//simple delete the line, save the file, close the editor
git rebase -i HEAD~2
//commit just deleted locally

//apply the DELETION to remote server, the + sign before the name of the branch you are pushing,
//this tells git to force the push
git push origin +mast3r
```

There is now better way to do same
```js
1. git reset --hard CommitIDToBeReverted
2. git clean -f -d
3. git push -u origin +NameOfBranch
```

Anthony said at replies, to use reset HEAD :
```js
git reset --hard HEAD~2
versus
git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

You can REVERT (or you can also call it *DELETE*) the Git Commit **BOTH Locally and Remotely** if you follow the steps as given below via git command line.

Run the following command to see the commit id that you want to revert

        git log --oneline --decorate --graph

You will get like a following screenshot [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rnRUD.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rnRUD.png)

If you also check remote **(via Web Interface)** then you can see that this would be same as shown below

[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWluh.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/IWluh.png)

As per screenshot currently you are on commit id **e110322** however you want to revert back to **030bbf6** BOTH **LOCALLY and REMOTELY**.

**Perform the following steps to DELETE/REVERT Commits Locally+Remotely**

* * *

First Locally Reverting to commit id **030bbf6**

        git reset --hard 030bbf6

followed by

        git clean -f -d

These two commands clean force reset to commit stage **030bbf6** as shown below in snapshot

now if you run git status then you'll see that you are TWO Commits BEHIND from the remote branch as shown below [![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjsxp.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Gjsxp.png)

Run following to update your indexes (if there are any updates). It is recommended that you ask all developers not to accept any pull requests on main remote branch.

        git fetch --all

Once you are done with it then you are required to **Push** this commit **forcefully** by using **+** symbol in-front of branch as shown below. I have used here as *master* branch, you can replace it with any

[![enter image description here](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DOIU.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/2DOIU.png) 

        git push -u origin +master

now if you see the web interface of remote then commit there should be reverted as well.

### Merge to Master

0-
Commit & push to current **current** branch

1-
Checkout & pull **master** for latest

2-
Checkout **current** branch

3-
rclick master > merge **master** to **current** branch

4-
Commit & push **current** branch

* * *

### CherryPick

-checkout the **remote** u want
-create new **branch**
-cherry pick there, by going to **commits list** and rclick > Cherry-Pick Commit

when you doing cherry pick, **already commit the changes** to new branch, the only thing you have to do is to **PUSH** the branch!
