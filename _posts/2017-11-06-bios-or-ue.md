Is a free (as in freedom) BIOS or UEFI replacement, initialising the hardware and booting your 
operating system.

## Why use Libreboot?

Many people use non-free proprietary boot firmware, even if they use GNU+Linux. Non-free BIOS/UEFI firmware often contains backdoors

The PSP is an ARM core with TrustZone technology, built onto the main CPU die. As such, **it has the ability to hide its own program code, scratch RAM, and any data it may have taken and stored from the lesser-privileged x86 system RAM (kernel encryption keys, login data, browsing history, keystrokes, who knows!)**. To make matters worse, the PSP theoretically has access to the entire system memory space (AMD either will not or cannot deny this, and it would seem to be required to allow the DRM “features” to work as intended), which means that it has at minimum MMIO-based access to the network controllers and any other PCI/PCIe peripherals installed on the system.

Is a replacement for your BIOS / UEFI with a strong focus on boot speed, security and flexibility. It is designed to boot your operating system as fast as possible without any compromise to security, with no back doors

In general because it leads to freedom on machines. Most firmware written today is completely closed source and the code bases are growing. Years ago a computer needed 100kb of compiled code in order to run the southbridge, now around 8mb of code are shipped in modern hardware.
