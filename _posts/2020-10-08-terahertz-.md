Terahertz waves fall in the far infrared/microwave part of the electromagnetic spectrum and can be produced by powerful lasers. Scientists have used terahertz pulses to control the properties of solid-state materials. They also have potential for manipulating living cells, as they **don't damage** them the way that **ultraviolet or infrared light does**.

They found the pulses activated genes involved in **motor neuron survival** and **mitochondrial function**. They also deactivated genes involved in cell differentiation, the process in which **stem cells** change into **specialized body cells**.

The scientists believe the terahertz pulses generate an electric field that causes **zinc ions** to move **inside cells**, impacting the function of transcription factors, which in turn activate or deactivate the genes they are responsible for.

The team used the apparatus to explore the effects of terahertz radiation on induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These are cells that have been taken from skin or blood and changed into stem cells. Scientists are seeking to turn them into other types of cells and tissues to help treat diseases like muscular dystrophy.
