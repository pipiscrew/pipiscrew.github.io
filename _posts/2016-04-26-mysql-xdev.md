This started with MySQL 5.7.12 and its new Document Store Functionality. The X Plugin extends MySQL Server to be able to function as a document store and the X Protocol, which is designed to expose the ACID compliant storage abilities of MySQL as a document store. **Documents are stored in JSON format** and enable schema-less storage. Using the X DevAPI you can **use a NoSQL-like syntax to execute Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)** operations against these documents. The server will be listening to port 33060 (configurable) for communications in the new protocol.
