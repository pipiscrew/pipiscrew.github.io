Generating your Bootstrap App, simple ... renaming files, folders, copy and pasting is SUPER error prone and well... it sucks overall. This can easily take a few days with debugging if you run into issues and perform a lot of typo's. Using the generator on AndroidBootstrap.com you can generate your application with your application name as well as the package (and folder structure) that you want to work with.

Includes a full working implementation of Fragments, Fragment Pager, ActionBar via AppCompat, Navigation Drawer, ViewPagerIndicator, Retrofit, GSON, Robotium for integration testing, API Consumption with an API on Parse.com and much more.
