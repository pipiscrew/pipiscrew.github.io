Microsoft is officially ending support for its aged mobile OS, Windows Phone 8.1, which means that users will no longer receive updates. It also marks the end of the road for Redmondâ€™s initial foray into phones, and essentially paves the way for Android and iOS to rule the roost.

With the death of WP 8.1, Microsoft is burying the Windows Phone brand after running with it over three generations starting in 2010. While the company initially drew praise for its novel approach to the mobile OS, a lack of compelling devices across price points, crucial features and popular third-party apps led to its slow demise.
