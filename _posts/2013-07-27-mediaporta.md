**MediaPortal**

Is a free open source media center software, ideal for turning your PC into a very advanced multi media center, or Home Theater PC (HTPC).

Using MediaPortal, you can listen to your favorite music and radio; watch your videos and DVDs; or view, schedule and record live TV, much like a digital video recorder such as TiVo, but better. And that's only the basic features!

**plugin - Moving Pictures Artwork and Info Copier**

Talk to your Moving Pictures database and make a copy of the current movie artwork(cover and backdrop) to the directory of your movie file. This way when browsing your movies through windows explorer or devices like WDTV the covers show up.
