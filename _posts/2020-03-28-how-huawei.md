Converting apps from **GMS** to **HMS** is “very easy,” for developers, according to Yu. Huawei provides development tools to help companies adapt to Huawei phones. Yu said this often requires just one or two days.

“We want to talk with all the leading app developers to quickly integrate HMS and to put their apps on Huawei App Gallery,” Yu emphasized. “This is the top priority, and we have built a global business development team to discuss [this] with the developers. But there are so many apps, it takes some time.” 

Huawei is collaborating with maps specialist TomTom to accelerate the process. However, TomTom’s app has not arrived in the App Gallery yet. Yu updated us on the situation, though he wasn’t able to provide a specific date or launch window.

“The partnership with TomTom is progressing very well. TomTom will provide location services in HMS, and a map service,” Yu said. “We want to give consumers a stand-alone app for navigation too. I hope by working with TomTom, we can bring a better experience than Google Maps in the future.”

Huawei’s voice assistant now has a name, **Celia**, and is available in selected regions and languages on board the Huawei P40. Developing Celia is important, as Huawei can’t use Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa, but that Huawei is willing to work with Google again — if that becomes possible.
