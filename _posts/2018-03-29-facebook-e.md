Facebook said on Wednesday it would end its partnerships with several large data brokers who help advertisers target people on the social network, a step that follows a scandal over how Facebook handles personal information.

The worldâ€™s largest social media company is under pressure to improve its handling of data after disclosing that information about 50 million Facebook users wrongly ended up in the hands of political consultancy Cambridge Analytica.

Facebook has for years given advertisers the option of targeting their ads based on data collected by companies such as Acxiom (https://www.acxiom.com/) and Experian (https://www.experian.com/).
