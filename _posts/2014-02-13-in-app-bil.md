> The application had 4.4 rating based on more than 11,000 user reviews
> 
> We have offered to our users a possibility to remove ads by buying a registration code via PayPal. Buying Ad-free version via Google play store was not possible, because our country is not on the list of supported locations for merchants which are allowed to sell paid applications on Google store.

<span style="color: #ff0000;">**1**</span>-open SDKmanager and download **Google Play Billing Library**

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span>**-the apk should be in **release** mode otherwise when trying to upload it to **GDeveloperConsole**

[![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap563.png "snap563")](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap563.png)

how to prepare for release :

[http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing.html](http://developer.android.com/tools/publishing/preparing.html)

[http://sreedevr.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/exporting-a-signed-apk-to-upload-android/](http://sreedevr.wordpress.com/2013/10/28/exporting-a-signed-apk-to-upload-android/)

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">7</span>**-then after success upload to BETA TESTING tab it should enable anyone has the APK make a purchase right?

-NO! you have to create a google group and authorize it! via [http://groups.google.com](http://groups.google.com)

![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap606.png "snap606")

[![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap596b1.png "snap596b")](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap596b1.png)<span style="color: #ff0000;">**7b**</span>- what does that mean? who knows!!! just follow me :

a-create a dummy google group (add any gmail to participate)

b-paste the group name to textfield and press ADD (in this point nothing changes to modal^)

close the modal and

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span>**-go to upper-right dropdown and select **PUBLISH**!

![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap603.png "snap603")

now the APK 'moved' from **BETA TESTING** to **PRODUCTION** (but with **BETA flag**!)

![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap6041.png "snap604")

go back to **BETA TESTING** tab!

the needed link will be there!

[![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap608.png "snap608")](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap608.png)

now anyone wants to participate and exists at google group of course! should navigate to this link to accept is a tester! otherwise nothing works...

also Google writes :

> Your test account CANNOT BE THE SAME AS THE PUBLISHER ACCOUNT. If it is, purchases won't go through.

![](https://www.pipiscrew.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/snap6101.png "snap610")

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">FYI</span>** - always download the APK from the link provided (or use the actual release APK) ^^^ otherwise when going to purchase you will get :

> This version of the application is not configured for billing through Google Play
