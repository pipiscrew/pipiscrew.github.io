Using display: flow-root on an element will perform this clearing for us. Instead of needing to apply the clearfix hack we can use the CSS display property on the container with a value of flow-root.

```js
.container {
  display: flow-root;
}
```

The border then clears the float and following content displays after our contained floated element.

**A new value of the display property has landed in Chrome Canary and Firefox Nightlies.**
