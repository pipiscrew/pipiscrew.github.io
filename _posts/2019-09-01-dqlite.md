Dqlite (“distributed SQLite”) extends SQLite across a cluster of machines, with automatic failover and high-availability to keep your application running. It uses C-Raft, an optimised Raft implementation in C, to gain high-performance transactional consensus and fault tolerance while preserving SQlite’s outstanding efficiency and tiny footprint.
