Denuvo are leaders in the field of video game protection, the same cannot be said about their website. Resident Evil 7, after just five days on the market, the Denuvo-protected PC version has already appeared on pirate sites.

Appears to have been sent by Capcom.

"This is Jun Matsumoto from CAPCOM Japan. I have a interested in the Denuvo Anti-Tamper solution to protect our game software. If you have a white paper about details, please send me. (ex. platform, usage, price, etc…) And, if you have a sales agent in Japan, please tell me the contact point. Thank you for your cooperations"

 sent by Jan Newger of Google, who wanted to learn more about Denuvo.

"I’m working in the security team at Google, and would like to evaluate the denuvo product to get an understanding on how it would integrate with existing solutions"

But for every business opportunity, there are dozens of emails from angry pirates, each looking to vent their anger.

"Why do you have to make such shit software to fuck over pc gamers with DRM bullshit. Please inform the companies you work with that if your DRM is implemented on games they are selling, they will lose thousands of customers. Thanks"
