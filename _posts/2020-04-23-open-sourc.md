In SQL Server 2019, added a Java language extension, which enables secure execution of Java programs in the context of a SQL Server query. This enables a wide range of scenarios such as performing advanced text and data preparation tasks, reaching out to external APIs to get data and also training machine learning models and model scoring.

They announce that we are open sourcing the Java language extension for SQL Server on [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/tree/master/language-extensions/java).
