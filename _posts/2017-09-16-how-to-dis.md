W+R > gpedit.msc

Local Computer Policy/Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/System/Logon > the **Hide Entry Points for Fast User Switching**  should be enabled, by default is **Not Configured**

Or you can disable it this way through the registry.
1. Type regedit in RUN or Startmenu Searchbox and press Enter. It'll open Registry Editor.
2. Now go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System
3. In right-side pane, create a new DWORD value HideFastUserSwitching and set its value to 1
4. That's it. Now "Switch User" option will be disabled from Welcome screen as well as from Shutdown menu.
