### [Privacy Badger](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/privacy-badger/pkehgijcmpdhfbdbbnkijodmdjhbjlgp)Â +Â [UBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en)

Let's block all the ads! Sites look cleaner, load waayy faster, and pry less. These are the first extensions I install onÂ *any*Â browser.

### [Nano Defender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en)

Let's block all the anti-adblockers! Many sites these days will try to get you to turn off your adblocker, but once you set upÂ [Nano Defender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nano-defender/ggolfgbegefeeoocgjbmkembbncoadlb?hl=en), you'll no longer have to deal with that. Note: To use alongside Ublock Origin, I had to go through aÂ [few extra steps](https://jspenguin2017.github.io/uBlockProtector/#extra-installation-steps-for-ublock-origin)Â first.

### [Hover](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok/related)Â +Â [Unpaywall](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en)/ ByPass Paywalls

Let's block all the login/paywalls! Are you starting to see a pattern here? ðŸ˜› The web can be full of thrash sometimes. WithÂ [Hover](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hover-bypass-paywalls-sub/ajbennpkmbahpfdalicgaogjbfhngeok)Â &Â [Unpaywall](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unpaywall/iplffkdpngmdjhlpjmppncnlhomiipha?hl=en), I can say goodbye to Medium and journal paywalls. If you're a fan of open source and have an extra minute to spend, check out thisÂ [extension](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome)Â instead.

### [Shut Up](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/shut-up-comment-blocker/oklfoejikkmejobodofaimigojomlfim?hl=en)

Sometimes when I'm consuming content, I'll be tempted to see what others are saying about it. That's... not always good.

### [Reader Mode](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en)

Occasionally, even after all these purges, the content on a site will still be ridiculously hard to read- sometimes because they used a funky font and set the size to 8px, or sometimes because there are a million other article suggestions, plus three sidebars, plus an obnoxious navigation header that never goes away. In cases like these, I just useÂ [Reader Mode](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en).

### [Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)

[Grammarly](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grammarly-for-chrome/kbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhen?hl=en)Â effortlessly corrects any pesky spelling and grammatical mistakes I make.

### [Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)

[Video Speed Controller](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/video-speed-controller/nffaoalbilbmmfgbnbgppjihopabppdk?hl=en)Â allows you to control the playback speed on any site. Set the default pace to 1.10x and you'll go through videos 10% faster without even noticing. Or if you're on other end of the spectrum like me, and Youtube's 2x doesn't match your pace, set it to 2.5x+ to get through lengthy monologues as fast as possible ðŸ˜¼

### [The Great Suspender](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-great-suspender/klbibkeccnjlkjkiokjodocebajanakg?hl=en)

Makes Chrome use less resources by suspending tabs you're not using. Computers run much more smoothly when this is enabled, especially if you're a compulsive tab opener.

### [Tab Snooze](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en)

Ran into an interesting rabbit hole or website that you'd really like to check out, but don't have the time right now? UseÂ [Tab Snooze](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tab-snooze/pdiebiamhaleloakpcgmpnenggpjbcbm?hl=en), and it'll magically reopen the tabs later.

### [Google Keep](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi?hl=en)/Â [Notion Web Clipper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/notion-web-clipper/knheggckgoiihginacbkhaalnibhilkk?hl=en)

I used to useÂ [Google Keep](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-keep-chrome-extens/lpcaedmchfhocbbapmcbpinfpgnhiddi?hl=en)Â heavily before, to save snippets and links and to add my own notes to the stuff I read online, but I've started moving towardsÂ [Notion](https://blog.maskys.com/my-best-chrome-extensions/notion.so)Â these days, as it's a lot more organized. An important feature both have is that they're cross-platform, which means I can type out a fresh thought on my phone and flesh out the concept on my PC later.

### [News Feed Eradicator for Facebook](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator-for/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en)

I rarely use FB these days, and that's in large part thanks to this extension. I can just pop in to share something interesting or to tell people NOT to message me on Messenger, without being sucked in by the infinite feed.

### [Minimal Twitter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/minimal-twitter/pobhoodpcipjmedfenaigbeloiidbflp?hl=en)

I do use Twitter, and this completely cleans up the interface.

### [View Image](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/view-image/jpcmhcelnjdmblfmjabdeclccemkghjk?hl=en)

Brings back the view image button on Google Images! ðŸ¤—

### [Simplify Gmail](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/simplify-gmail/pbmlfaiicoikhdbjagjbglnbfcbcojpj/related?hl=en)

Recommended byÂ [Matej](https://twitter.com/matejmecka?lang=en), this lovely extension cleans up Gmail's UI and hides the obnoxious logo.
