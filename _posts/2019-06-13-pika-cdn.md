68.93% of global users can run modern JavaScript (ES2019) without a single polyfill or Babel plugin. Unfortunately, sites need to compile their deployed code to support legacy browsers. This adds slow polyfills and transpiler bloat for everyone.

Stop penalizing your users. The Pika CDN optimizes packages to each individual user. Older browsers get the polyfills they need while modern browsers get modern, bloat-free code and faster overall load times.
