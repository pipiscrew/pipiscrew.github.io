Ad-blocker developers fear their Chrome extensions will be wiped out by proposed changes to Chrome APIs.

Raymond Hill, the developer of uBlock Origin and uMatrix, raised concerns on Tuesday via the Chromium bug tracker that upcoming changes to certain Chrome APIs would mean his extensions can "no longer exist". 

He explains that the new API would not impact Adblock Plus as it "merely enforces" that particular ad blocker's way of blocking. That in itself is a potential concern, given Google and others reportedly pay Adblock Plus to have their ads whitelisted. And the new restriction on third-party ad blockers follows Google's own ad-blocking efforts in Chrome.
