Custom UI for Apache mod_autoindex generated pages.

Apache's mod_autoindex feature is very useful when you want to set up a simple file sharing server, but its design is trapped in 1997. By default it serves HTML 3.2.

So, he decided to give it an overdue makeover by taking advantage of modern components like Bootstrap, jQuery, Google Fonts, and Font Awesome!
