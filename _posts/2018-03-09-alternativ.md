Days now, the 'Translate to English' lost from my Chrome context menu. When I went to Chrome Settings, got that :

I created this **bookmarklet**, add it to bookmark toolbar, once you are in a page with non English language click this bookmark icon!

[Drag and drop this link to bookmark toolbar](javascript:void function(){window.open('https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&u=' + location)}();)
