How is this different from the aeropress? seems a bit smaller, but real espresso is extracted using high-pressure steam, right? this is just hot h2o.

The Aeropress pours a cup of coffee,through a paper filter, where as the Minipresso pours a single shot espresso. Minipresso pumps hot water to 116psi/8bar pressure. Our compact size is a key feature. If you are looking a full cup of coffee the Aero is a great product. If you are looking for a quality shot of espresso, anywhere on the go, that is what the MP is made for. If you want both a cup of coffee and espresso, you wouldnt be the first to own both machines.
