**Lineage** has problems to run with **NetGuard**. NetGuard doesnt have any bug run on **Android v10**. Tickets raised :

    Lineage 17.1 - https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/1706
    Lineage 16.0 - https://gitlab.com/LineageOS/issues/android/-/issues/1629

**NetGuard author**, replied :

> Some Android versions, including LineageOS for some devices, contain a bug resulting in all internet traffic being blocked. Mostly, you can workaround this bug by enabling filtering in NetGuard's Advanced options. If this doesn't solve the issue, the problem can unfortunately not be fixed or worked around by NetGuard.

**Filter Traffic** option doesnt do anything.. :(

or

if you stack on boot loop, the solution HOME+VOLUMEUP+POWER not worked, put the phone on download mode, inject TWRP with Odin, Wipe Cache + Data... 

Reflash the firmware..!! Is working.

## Remove bloatware from stock ROM

Either with [Magisk](https://android.gadgethacks.com/how-to/best-way-uninstall-all-types-bloatware-any-android-0196667/) or [Titanium Backup](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1394104), if Titanium doesnt requesting write access to storage, do it manually, otherwise crashes.
