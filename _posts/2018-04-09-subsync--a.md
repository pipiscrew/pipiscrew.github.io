I hope this little tool comes to help you out as much as it did for me. His girlfriend and zerratar both struggled with using the VLC Sub addon for downloading subtitles, a tool that we previously been using lots! And when that tool stopped working on later days, keep being unresponsive and continuesly crashing VLC, we had to manually look for those darn subtitles on the web and if you have a lot of shows to watch then its a huge pain in the ass.
