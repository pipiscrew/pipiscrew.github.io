Lemmings was first released 25 years ago for the Amiga, but this is the first time the classic has come to mobile. You may be wondering why Sony is the one bringing it to the platform, but the company actually owns the Lemmings franchise. 

Sony acquired Psygnosis – the studio that published Lemmings – back in 1993, in turn buying the rights to Lemmings.
