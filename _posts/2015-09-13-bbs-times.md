Hi, this is XtreeMan. I ran a BBS in the Netherlands (Europe) called 'Edge
of Honor' a.k.a. EOH from 1991 till 1998. I started out with a 2400baud
modem on a single phoneline using Remote Access v1.something and stopped
having four lines (2xISDN/V34) running on a Novell network over three
computers using Desqview to run multiple nodes on a single computer with a
total of 4 gigabytes of files.

Together with Synopsis, EOH spawned numerous, widely used, RA doors like
WarezTag!, Logon!Matrix, HexaChat (aka PhotoChat). The board has been a
base for countless groups over the years, ranging from ANSI art to
H/P/A/V/C/T groups.

I consider that time periode as one of my best! Met loads of interesting
people, went to great parties. Greetings go out to Synopsis, The Manta,
Quicks, Zymotic, COWS, ACME, Slackjaw, Roelf, Fatal Error, Blue Sky,
KipBrigade, Logica, SCAM!, PSP, UCF, Sir Listerique, Dork Lemming,
Industrial, Stonehedge, Foxivision, Berry Lam and all who I forgot now..

Big thanks to Jason for his effort on the documentary.

Signing off into the boredom of internet...
