On the [GMO Explained](https://www.pipiscrew.com/2018/04/gmo-explained-by-earthopensource/) article, we found that the [EU Commission](https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/eu-policy/eu-legislation/brief-overview_en), declaring :

Organic production respects natural systems and cycles. Biological and mechanical production processes and land-related production should be used to achieve sustainability, **without having recourse to genetically modified organisms** (GMOs). Moreover, organic logo guarantees :

➜ The production respects nature. ➜ The products are produced in a sustainable way. ➜ The operators of organic production are controlled once per year by **control bodies** to ensure that they respect all organic rules and all health and consumer protection rules. ➜ Farm animals are freely grazing in the open-air and they are treated according to enhanced animal welfare conditions. ➜ **<span style="color: #ff0000;">Genetically modified organisms are not allowed in organic agriculture</span>**. ➜ For food, there are strict limitations to the use of chemical pesticides and fertilisers, antibiotics ➜ Organic agriculture strictly limits the use of food additives and processing aids and other inputs. ➜ Most of the inputs for farm production come from the farm itself using local resources and local knowledge. ➜ Each and every time you buy an organic product from your supermarket, or choose an organic wine at your favourite restaurant, you can be sure they were produced according to strict rules aimed at respecting the environment and animal welfare.

## Who guarantees is organic ?

A product can be considered organic if it has the **relevant indication** attesting the organic production method in accordance with the rules written in Regulation (EC) No. [834/2007](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A32007R0834), [889/2008](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2008/889/oj) and Reg. (EU) [271/2010](http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32010R0271). These regulations concern organic crops, aquaculture and stock-farming.

The general format of the code number is **AB-CDE-999**, where **AB** is the ISO code of the country where the checks take place, **CDE** is a term establishing a link with the organic production, such as "bio" or "org" or "eko" (their derivatives or diminutives, alone or combined, may be used throughout the Community language) and **999** is a reference number of **control body**.

You should find **on every organic** product's label, the **code number** of the **control body** (is the organic certification, organisation) responsible for the checks on the operator who carried out the last operation. One **control body** can support many companies and products. For example if we do a [search](https://world.openfoodfacts.org/label/it-bio-006) for the **code number** appears on the screenshot, we will see that exists to 180 products. These products certified by one control body.

The **code number** is a **proof** that the product was produced or processed in **accordance** with the **organic regulation requirements**. ([src](https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/organic/consumer-trust/certification-and-confidence/controls-and-inspections/code-numbers_en))

You can search the **code number** appears on the screenshot at EU Commission site**,** by going [here](https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/ofis_public/actor_cbeu/ctrl.cfm?targetUrl=home) or click [here](http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/ofis_public/r8/ctrl_r8.cfm?targetUrl=home&lang=en) and clicking at left 'actual list' or 'control bodies from member states', and find the control body of this.

## How many pesticides are used in organic agriculture?

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
Most people wrongly assume that no pesticides are used in organic farming. However, it is important to note that organic farming takes a completely different approach to the use of pesticides compared to conventional farming.

In the EU, according to the [pesticide approvals database](http://ec.europa.eu/food/plant/pesticides/eu-pesticides-database/public/?event=activesubstance.selection&language=EN), there are currently **479 substances** approved (as 19/03/2020) for use as pesticides, of these only **28 are approved for use in organic** agriculture.

## How to Know If Your Fruits and Vegetables Are Organic?

If you're like most people, you buy fruits and vegetables for health reasons, and here's where accurate labeling is key. If you want to know if the product you're purchasing is truly organic, look at the Price Look Up (**PLU**) sticker. If the produce is organic, the code will contain five-digits **beginning with the number 9**. Nonorganic counterparts will have four digits. For example, organically grown bananas will be 94011, compared to 4011 for those treated with chemicals and pesticides. A five-digit PLU beginning with the number 8 means the item is genetically modified, which some research indicates may pose health risks.

The PLU system is **voluntary** and based on business needs and nothing else, some items will be marked with PLU codes while others are not.

## How to Know If Your Eggs Are Organic?

![](https://i.imgur.com/wFhEP4c.jpg)

The European Union has defined an egg code that consists of :

*   a number indicating the method of production

*   a two letter code for the country of origin

*   a registration number indicating the hen laying establishment

The **egg stamp is <span style="color: #ff0000;">required</span>** in the EU **on all class A eggs** **unless** these are sold **directly on the farm**.

The first number of the egg code defines four levels of production quality in decreasing order :

0 = organic egg production
1 = free-range eggs
2 = deep litter indoor housing
3 = cage farming

The mark on **organic egg** production as **level 0** might indicate that there is nothing better than that. However it **does not** indicate s**ustainable agriculture where hens are fed from the organic farm alone**. ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_marking))

[The Science of Boiling an Egg](http://newton.ex.ac.uk/teaching/CDHW/egg/)

The protein in **egg white** turns solid at between 61c and 65c, whereas the protein in **egg yolk** does not set until you get to 66c to 70c. So, to soft boil an egg, put the egg in water held at **exactly 65c**. The egg white will set but the egg yolk will remain runny. You will have the perfectly cooked egg every time. The only drawback of this method is that you need to leave the egg in the water for about an **hour and a half**.

The reason eggs are refrigerated in the US, unlike most of the world, is because eggs are washed which removes the natural barrier for bacteria. ([src](https://www.organicvalley.coop/blog/why-does-us-refrigerate-eggs/))
