Build workspaces in a few quick clicks using FME Desktop's drag-and-drop interface. Workspaces are repeatable and can be run again and again. Is like the Swiss army knife for your data with hundreds of transformer tools (includes 475+ data transformers) to get the job done. Here are just a handful of sample scenarios.

No coding is required, which means you can spend more time using your data and less time fighting with it. (And if you really want, FME Desktop also supports Python).
