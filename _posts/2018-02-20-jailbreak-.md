Several different jailbreaks are available for different combinations of hardware and versions of iOS. LiberIOS and Electra jailbreaks overlap, doing the same job for iOS 11 devices. It is up to you which jailbreak to choose; they both exploit the same vulnerabilities, and should work about the same with iOS Forensic Toolkit. We have successfully tested the following jailbreaks:

**iOS 10:**
h3lix (iOS 10.0-10.3.3), 32-bit devices, https://h3lix.tihmstar.net/
Meridian (iOS 10.0-10.3.3), 64-bit devices, https://meridian.sparkes.zone/

**iOS 11:**
LiberIOS (iOS 11.0-11.1.2), 64-bit devices, http://newosxbook.com/liberios/
Electra (iOS 11.0-11.1.2), 64-bit devices, https://coolstar.org/electra/

There is also [g0blin](https://g0blin.sticktron.net/) jailbreak for iOS 10.3.x, limited to A7-A9 devices (so iPhone 5S, iPhone 6/Plus, iPhone 6S/Plus, iPhone SE, 6th-gen iPod and some iPads), but we have not tested our software with it (though it should work).
