Only works on iOS 11.0 through iOS 11.1. Apple has stopped signing those versions so should anything go wrong, you can only upgrade to iOS 11.2 and thatâ€™s the end of the jailbreaking adventure.

LiberiOS is what is called a tethered jailbreak. That practically means that you need to perform the jailbreaking process every time you reboot your phone.
