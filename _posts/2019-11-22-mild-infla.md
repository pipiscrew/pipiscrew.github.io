nflammation in the body isn’t unusual — this is a normal response to illnesses and can result from something as simple as catching a virus or developing an infection. However, inflammation should be a temporary state; **when chronic, it causes all sorts of health issues, including potentially the development of cancer**. Chronic inflammation has been linked to obesity, low-quality diets, autoimmune diseases, and more. As a consequence, someone experiencing inflammation may find that they also experience ‘brain fog,’ a term that is often used to refer to **trouble concentrating, slow thinking speeds, word jumbling**, and more.
