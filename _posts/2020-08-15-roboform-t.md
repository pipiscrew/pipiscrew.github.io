In our days we like to carry all the information on mobile.. What about the roboform passcards (mine are 837!) ?? The folowing technique is the same either on v6.x or v7.x

**v6.x**

**v7.x**

**Export > Save**

then you have to use [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) v2.x (the one built on .net, the v1.x havent to import from roboform html)
tested versions : KeePass-v2.25 / KeePass-v2.30

-open the application
-create new dbase
-import from roboform html > export as v1.x format! if you plan to use it via [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.keepass](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.android.keepass)
