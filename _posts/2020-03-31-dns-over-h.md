DNS over HTTPS will work only if your configured DNS server has DoH support. You might need to [change your DNS server](https://www.howtogeek.com/167533/the-ultimate-guide-to-changing-your-dns-server/) to take advantage of DoH.

We recommend using Google’s own [Google Public DNS](https://developers.google.com/speed/public-dns/) or [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/dns/), which is the default DNS server when [DoH is enabled for Firefox](https://www.howtogeek.com/659252/how-to-enable-dns-over-https-in-firefox/). Google has a list of [DNS providers Chrome can use DoH with](https://www.chromium.org/developers/dns-over-https), including Cleanbrowsing, Comcast, DNS.SB, OpenDNS, and Quad9.

You can check to see if DNS over HTTPS is working in Chrome by visiting Cloudflare’s <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">[Browsing Experience Security Check](https://www.cloudflare.com/ssl/encrypted-sni/)</span>. Run the test by clicking the button and see whether “Secure DNS” is enabled or not.

Fortunately, DNS over HTTPS is becoming standard by default soon. Google [plans to enable DoH by default in Chrome 81](https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/forum/#!msg/net-dev/lIm9esAFjQ0/vJ93oMbAAgAJ).    ([src](https://www.howtogeek.com/660088/how-to-enable-dns-over-https-in-google-chrome/))

The quick way is to use the browser builtin support :

**Chrome :**

`chrome://flags/#dns-over-http`

enable it, then you have to set the DoH server throught the common TCP/IPv4 Properties ([howto](https://www.howtogeek.com/167533/the-ultimate-guide-to-changing-your-dns-server/))

^in this way you can use DoH DNS Server as IP only. Now days the most common is to use DoH with hostname, to do it on Chrome you have to start it with command arguments [more](https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038086532-Using-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH-with-OpenDNS)

**Firefox :**

@ options > network > connection, is **ready to go** with hostname ![](https://i.imgur.com/jacgYir.png)

Apart from browser / os setup, you can achieve the same using a DNS proxy application
