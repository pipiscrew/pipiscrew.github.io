Robots will make us into their pets because we just want to be taken care of, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak has warned.

The artificial intelligence that will control the world used to worry Wozniak, he told a technology conference. But he has realised that it will be good for us because robots will opt to keep us as part of nature, reports TechRepublic.

"It's actually going to turn out really good for humans,” he told the conference. “And it will be hundreds of years down the stream before they'd even have the ability.”

By that time, the robots will be aware of their place in the world and opt to keep us around, in the same way we keep family dogs, he said. As such, he joked that he had taken to feeding his dog “filet steak and chicken every night because 'do unto others'”.
