It provides an application class that has a fluent interface with functions to:

- Define model objects
- Define view objects
- Route HTTP requests that match certain URL patterns to handler functions
- Middleware functions to process details of the current HTTP request like user authentication, user sessions, etc..

The framework can handle all requests from a single application script.
