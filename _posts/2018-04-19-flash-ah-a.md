Cisco has patched a serious vulnerability in its WebEx software that lets an attacker remotely execute code on target machines via poisoned Adobe Flash files.

The vulnerability, discovered and reported to Cisco by researcher Alexandros Zacharis of ENISA (the EU's network and information security body), stems from the failure by WebEx to properly check Flash (.swf) files when they are uploaded to a meeting room.
