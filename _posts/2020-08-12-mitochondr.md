Research hints that the energy-generating organelles of cells may play a surprisingly pivotal role in mediating anxiety and depression. Carmen Sandi recalls the skepticism she faced at first.

Mitochondria are the tiny structures inside complex (eukaryotic) cells that manufacture adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, the chemical fuel for most metabolic processes. “ATP is the energy that sort of allows for living cells to do what they do when they’re alive,” said Lisa Kalynchuk, vice president for research at the University of Victoria in Canada. The organelles are ancient invaders — the remnants of symbiotic bacteria that integrated themselves into host cells about 2 billion years ago and specialized for energy production. Mitochondria still carry a small amount of DNA of their own, although with just 37 genes, they have less genetic material than any living bacteria.

Scientists also seem to agree that ATP is involved. “The ability the body has to be sensitive to the outside world, and then to mount a response internally, is all energy-driven,” Picard said. Studies suggest that overly stressed animals may show dampened ATP production, which can impair many processes but especially cell division. This is especially relevant to the hippocampus, a brain structure vital for memory-encoding, learning, emotion — and processing stress. It is one of the few parts of the brain where, even in adult mammals, there is some evidence that new neurons may be created all the time.

Mitochondria are known as energy generators for cells. But in cells of the **adrenal glands**, mitochondria also synthesize the hormone **cortisol**, which triggers stress responses throughout the body.

The [adrenal glands](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/adrenal-gland) (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that **produce a variety of hormones** including adrenaline and the steroids aldosterone and cortisol. They are found **above the kidneys**. Each gland has an outer cortex which produces steroid hormones and an inner medulla.
