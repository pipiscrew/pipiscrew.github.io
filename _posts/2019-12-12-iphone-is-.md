The bigger news? The iPhone has finally become the world’s preferred porn streaming device, snatching the reins from Android.

Yep, iOS accounted for 52.8 percent of all mobile traffic, leaving Android in second place with 46.6 percent. That’s what happens when Apple releases a slightly more affordable iPhone, I guess. By contrast, in 2018, Android held a 54.4-percent dominance over iOS‘ 44.4 percent.
