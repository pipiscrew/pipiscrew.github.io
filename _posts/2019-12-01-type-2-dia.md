TYPE 2 diabetes occurs when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin to function properly or the body’s cells don’t react to insulin. When one is diagnosed with the condition, certain lifestyle choices and diet will need to change in order to better manage the condition. One surprising activity is known to raise blood sugar regulation.

Type 2 diabetes is a condition that causes the body to lose control of the amount of sugar in the blood. The body doesn’t respond to insulin properly and may not produce enough, causing blood sugar levels to become too high. If blood sugar levels aren’t controlled properly and stay too high, a number of problems can occur, including kidney failure, nerve damage, foot ulcers, heart disease and stroke.

Exercise is also a necessity and its advised to aim for at least 150 minutes of physical excursion a week.

Exposure to light in the hours leading up to bedtime, in particular, the light from the electronic device or television may affect health including weight and blood sugar levels.

Our circadian rhythm is also influenced by the nightly secretion of the hormone melatonin, and light at night inhibits the production of this sleep-promoting hormone. That, in turn, could affect the hormone leptin,3 otherwise known as the satiety hormone that signals your brain that you are full, so when this hormone messaging is thrown off, you gain weight.

It’s recommended to have as low as five lux of light at night in order for it not to disturb the circadian rhythm. [src](https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/health/1211561/type-2-diabetes-causes-phone-night-diet-treatment-lower-blood-sugar)
