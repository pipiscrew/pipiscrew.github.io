Alpha Foods, the vegetarian prepared food manufacturer, has raised $28 million in financing for its portfolio of vegetarian burritos, tamales, nuggets, pizzas, burgers, patties, and sausages.

While the **Morningstar Farms** brand might seem a bit stale, the market has been reinvigorated through the marketing muscle and venture dollars supplied by companies like **Beyond Meat** (owned by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leonardo DiCaprio</span> and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bill Gates</span>) and **Impossible Foods** (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bill Gates</span>), whose products have captured contracts from some of the world’s biggest fast food chains — including McDonald’s, KFC and Burger King.
