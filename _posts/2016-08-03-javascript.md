Is a small and simple Python 3.5+ translator to JavaScript which aims to be able to translate most of the Python's core semantics without providing a full python-in-js environment, as most existing translators do. It tries to emit code which is simple to read and check and it does so by switching to ES6 construct when necessary. This allows to simplify the needs of polyfills for many of the expected Python behaviors.
