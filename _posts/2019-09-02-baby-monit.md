One modern trend in child raising is the use of baby monitors to ensure the well-being of babies overnight and during nap times.  Parents are constantly bombarded with information on sleep safety, SIDS, and newborn breathing issues, so naturally, they want to do everything they can to keep their baby safe.  **Unfortunately**, most baby monitors produce continuous, **high levels of microwave radiation**, directly targeting your baby while they sleep, so the well-intentioned use of baby monitors can **cause more harm than good**.
