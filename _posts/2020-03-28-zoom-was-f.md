After an investigation by Motherboard's Vice, video-conferencing app Zoom was found to be sharing user data with Facebook. Data was being sent from iPhones to Facebook, **regardless of whether users had Facebook accounts or not**, and the fact that data was being shared was not made apparent in privacy policies.

We originally **implemented** the "**Login with Facebook**" feature using the **Facebook SDK** for iOS (Software Development Kit) in order to provide our users with another convenient way to access our platform. However, we were made aware on Wednesday, March 25, 2020, that the **Facebook SDK** was **collecting device information** unnecessary for us to provide our services. The information collected by the Facebook SDK did not include information and activities related to meetings such as attendees, names, notes, etc., but rather included information about devices such as:

*   the mobile OS type and version

*   the device time zone

*   device OS

*   device model

*   carrier

*   screen size

*   processor cores

*   disk space

Our customers' privacy is incredibly important to us, and therefore we decided to remove the Facebook SDK in our iOS client and have reconfigured the feature so that users will still be able to log in with Facebook via their browser.
