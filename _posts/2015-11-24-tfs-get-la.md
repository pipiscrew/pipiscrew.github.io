### Microsoft Team Foundation Server Power Tools 2012

[https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35775](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35775)

-Install cmd line version only
use this cmdline :
`tfpt scorch /recursive /deletes C:\Projects\pipiscrew_studio`

* * *

TFPT Scorch â€“ Ensure source control and the local disk are identical

Your local disk will be scanned for:
(1) items that are not in source control
(2) items which are different on disk from the workspace version
(3) items which are in the workspace but are missing on disk

-Items not in source control will be deleted from disk, just as with the
tfpt treeclean command. 
-Items determined to be different on disk from the workspace version will be redownloaded from the server. Items missing on disk will also be redownloaded. 
-Items with pending changes are ignored.
