## Kademlia

The first generation peer-to-peer file sharing networks, such as Napster, relied on a central database to co-ordinate look ups on the network. Second generation peer-to-peer networks, such as Gnutella, used flooding to locate files, searching every node on the network. Third generation peer-to-peer networks use Distributed hash tables to look up files in the network. Distributed hash tables store resource locations throughout the network. A major criterion for these protocols is locating the desired nodes quickly.

Kademlia uses a "distance" calculation between two nodes. [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kademlia)
