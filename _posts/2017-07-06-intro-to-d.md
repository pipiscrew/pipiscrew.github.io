is a real-time, decentralized, offline first, graph database. Sure is a mouthful. Knowing a little bit about decentralized architecture we can understand the other features. Under the hood, GUN allows for data synchronization to happen seamlessly between all connected nodes by default. Itâ€™s offline first capabilities mean that if connectivity is lost to other nodes due to a network error or no availability, the application will store all changes locally and automatically synchronize as soon there is a connection. Finally, the flexible data storage model allows for tables with relations (MSSQL or MySQL), tree-structured document orientation (MongoDB), or a graph with circular references (Neo4j). Doing 15M+ ops/sec in just ~12KB gzipped.
