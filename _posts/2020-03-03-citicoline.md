Has been known for its ability to improve memory and reduce cognitive decline. Works by delivering choline (an **essential nutrient** used for the **construction of cell membranes, neurons and neuron dendrites**) to the brain where it is used to make **phosphatidylcholine** and **acetylcholine**. While phosphatidylcholine is used to **make new neurons** and similar structures, acetylcholine is used to pass **signals between neurons**. These functions make citicoline essential for both creating new structures and **increasing mental performance**. Citicoline is likely effective in <span style="color: #ff0000;">potentiating</span> **neuroplasticity** while producing neuroprotective effects. Researchers in Italy examined 349 patients.

Choline was officially recognized as an essential nutrient by the Institute of Medicine in 1998. Its role in the body is complex. It is needed for :

➜ neurotransmitter synthesis(acetylcholine)
➜ cell-membrane signaling (phospholipids)
➜ lipid transport (lipoproteins)
➜ methyl-group metabolism (homocysteine reduction)

It is the major dietary source of methyl groups via the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). At least 50 AdoMet-dependent reactions have been identified in mammals, and it is likely that the number is much higher. Such methylation reactions play major roles in biosynthesis of lipids, the regulation of several metabolic pathways, and detoxification in the body. Choline is required to make :

➜ thephospholipids phosphatidylcholine
➜ lysophosphatidylcholine
➜ choline plasmalogen
➜ sphingomyelin

essential components for all membranes.

It plays important roles in brain and memory development in the fetus and appears to decrease the risk of the development of neural tube defects.

An average diet supplies 200-600 mg of choline daily. Adequate Intake (AI), as established by the Food and Nutrition Board of the National Institute of Medicine, for adults is 550 mg per day.

There are **three** types :
• Choline Bitartrate - 41% choline density; cheap and ineffective. (aka [Now Foods.Choline & Inositol](https://iherb.com/pr/Now-Foods-Choline-Inositol-500-mg-100-Capsules/513))
• Alpha-GPC - 40% choline density; able to cross the blood-brain barrier.
• Citicoline - 18% choline plus cytidine, a two-for-one mental charger.
• [Cognizin Citicoline](https://cognizin.com/) - **patented** Citicoline known for its safety, absorption and stability,  99%+ pure citicoline. (aka [Qualia Pharma.Recolin](https://www.qualiapharma.com/recolin/))
