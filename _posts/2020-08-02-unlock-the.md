```js
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FeatureManagement\Overrides\0\2093230218]
"EnabledState"=dword:00000002
"EnabledStateOptions"=dword:00000000
```

Restart the device after you have made the change and you will notice that the new Start Menu is already visible after the restart. The new Start Menu changes the backgrounds of tiles to the theme to reduce colors significantly.

Edge's tabs are now displayed in the Alt-Tab dialog. Alt-Tab displays open program windows by default, and Microsoft modified the functionality in the next feature update to include tabs from the new Microsoft Edge web browser as well when the shortcut is used.
