### The X Plugin

Extends MySQL Server to be able to function as a document store. Running X Plugin enables MySQL Server to communicate with clients using the X Protocol, which is designed to expose the ACID compliant storage abilities of MySQL as a **document store. Documents are stored in JSON format and enable schema-less storage**. Using the X DevAPI you can use a NoSQL-like syntax to execute Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations against these documents.
