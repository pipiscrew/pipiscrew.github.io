The California school shooting suspect is a 'quiet' Boy Scout who opened fire on classmates on his 16th birthday
A high school student opened fire on five other students at Saugus High School in California's Santa Clarity Valley on Thursday, leaving two dead and three others injured.
The suspected shooter has been identified as Nathaniel Berhow, the Los Angeles Times and CNN reported, citing unnamed law-enforcement sources. He turned 16 on the day of the attack.
His neighbors and friends have largely described Berhow as a quiet, unassuming student who was active in varsity cross-country and his local Boy Scout squad, the LA Times, CNN, and the Associated Press reported.
The suspect attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head after the attack, and is now in a critical condition in hospital.
