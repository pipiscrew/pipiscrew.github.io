This problem usually appears randomly but it can also occur after an update is installed to .NET Framework. The process’s executable is **mscorsvw.exe** and it will be displayed in Task Manager under that name or as **.NET Runtime Optimization Service**. It doesn’t run so often and it’s a service that runs to optimize .NET Framework which, in return, makes sure apps and programs dependent on it run faster.

The **official answer** is that the process needs to **recompile** its libraries and that it should only run when the computer is idle. Microsoft also states that the process shouldn’t take more than a couple of minutes.

It’s not recommended to end this process immediately. 

Optimizing the process :

## 1st way

```js
//on x86 sytems
cd c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319 

//on x64 systems
cd c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319

ngen.exe executequeueditems
```

## 2nd way (microsoft github repository)

Download by click 'raw' then right-click 'save as' then double click the file to run
you can use the **WSF**

for **advanced** users there is also a **Powershell** sccript:
