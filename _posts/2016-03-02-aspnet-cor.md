Bear in mind **ASP.NET Core beta8 was** already 800% faster than **ASP.NET 4.6**, which itself was pretty nippy compared to many web frameworks and languages. RC2 is shaping up to be even faster – throw in some caching and you’ll be going back in time! 

ASP.NET Core and .NET Core come with the great advantage of only including the libraries and functions you explicitly want to use in your application rather than bringing in the entire framework. So you only “pay”, programmatically speaking, for what you use.
