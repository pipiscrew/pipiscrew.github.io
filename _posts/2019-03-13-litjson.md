A .Net library to handle conversions from and to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings.

LitJSON is written in C#, and itâ€™s intended to be small, fast and easy to use.

It's quick and lean, without external dependencies.
Just a few classes, so easily embeddable in your own code, or a very small assembly to ship with your code.
The code is highly portable, which in general makes it easy to adapt for new platforms.
