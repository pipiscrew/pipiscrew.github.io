**deb packages** are managed by package managers such as apt and aptitude. So whenever you install a software with it, they will automatically figure out if you have the dependencies that are required to run that software on your system and will install them for you.

if you are using a **tar ball install** it, you will have to figure out what that software depends on and each time you will have to check manually whether the dependencies of the software you are installing were already installed previously.
