you must close the connection even is broken.

```js
if (!General.db.IsConnected)
{
	General.log("[write2db] dbase is not connected");

	if (General.db != null)
	{
		General.log("[write2db] dbase is not null");

		try
		{
			//https://stackoverflow.com/a/31174539/1320686
			General.db.GetConnection().Close();
		}
		catch (Exception x) {
			General.log("[write2db] dbase is not null, tried to close but error occurred : " + x.Message);
		}
	}

	General.log("[write2db] trying to open dbase");

	/* READ CONFIG + CONNECT */
	string db_res = connect2db();
	if (db_res.Length > 0)
	{
		General.log("[write2db] trying to open dbase but error occurred : " + db_res);

		MessageBox.Show(db_res, Application.ProductName, MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error);
		Environment.Exit(-1);
		return;
	}
	/* READ CONFIG + CONNECT */

	General.log("[write2db] connection success!");
}

//proper way to check if is connected
public bool IsConnected
{
	//src - https://stackoverflow.com/a/34357667/1320686
	if (objConn == null | !objConn.State.HasFlag(ConnectionState.Open)) //INVALID ==> .State != ConnectionState.Open)
	{
		return false;
	}
	else
	{
		return true;
	}
}
```

```js
//https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.connectionstate(v=vs.110).aspx

Closed - The connection is closed.
Connecting - The connection object is connecting to the data source.
Executing - The connection object is executing a command.
Fetching - The connection object is retrieving data.
Open - The connection is open.```
