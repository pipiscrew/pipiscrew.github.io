Our brains and bodies respond naturally to rhythm.

This can be a biological rhythm. For example, the heartbeats of a mother and baby will synchronise with one another when they interact closely, and similar effects have been reported for couples.

But we also respond to external rhythms. The tempo of a song can naturally alter our breathing rate and heart rate.
