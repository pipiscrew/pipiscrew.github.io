Prevent Eye strain / Reduce Eye pain

Iris will gradually regulate blue light day and night. This will help your body to produce more melatonin at night. You will fall asleep faster and sleep deeper.

[https://iristech.co](https://iristech.co)

[Studies](http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/blue-light-has-a-dark-side) show that exposure to blue light a couple of hours before bedtime actually suppresses [melatonin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melatonin) and delays deep REM sleep significantly. So cutting back on tech use at night means getting better sleep, making people more productive at both work and school. ([ref](https://iristech.co/color-temperature-and-blue-light/))

It has 3 flavors :

**micro** - command line
**mini** - This is the entire Iris mini, no ui, no buttons, no many confusing options. What Iris does at night is based on your location it makes your screen a little more yellow or red depending on the value of the color temperature. This is like other softwares f.lux, Night Shift and other blue light blocking softwares.
**normal** as mini with timer for breaks.

**RULES:**
-for best results you must set the monitor brightness to 100% ([src1](https://iristech.co/brightness/)  [src2](https://iristech.co/pwm-flicker/)) (Im running the application on 3400K with 80 brightness - full satisfied)
-Lower K - better for your eyes!

**FAQ:**
-How to see the Low K working - you will see the effect when clicking the 'Use low-level Color API' - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUe_DeQXuww](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUe_DeQXuww)

warning, the GUI versions on the beginning warn user to restart windows, because modify something, at website explains :

> there is one file named gamma_ramp.reg, this will remove one limitation of the graphics drivers.

Setting a color temperature lower than 4500K, **is not possible without applying** the GdiIcmGammaRange registry fix (microsoft protecting the user against evil programs that invert the colors, blank the display, or play some other annoying trick with the gamma ramps [src](http://jonls.dk/2010/09/windows-gamma-adjustments/)). After applied, restart required.

the GUI version needed to detect the day/night hours, the commandline version (micro) is **18kb** ([mirror](http://www.mediafire.com/file/1lwwzaunu1m8a19/iris-micro-windows-0.0.5.zip)), you execute the needed batch file the application makes the needed adjustments and exits!

-Using the **micro** application, I found that when I lock the workstation (CTRL+L) and unlock it (after 5min) the adjustments made by **micro** application doesnt take place, I got a normal full brightness 100% view and I have to rerun the application every time I logon.
-This is normal (after unlock) and it's fixed in Iris and Iris mini, Bug in the OS not by product.

<center>![alt](https://i.imgur.com/mf5ViSY.png)</center>There is a bit of confusion about cooler and warmer color temperature. First of all color temperature is measured in Kelvins(K). Cooler temperature means higher value like 6500K (No blue light reduction) and warmer means lower values like 1900K (Candle light). [src](https://iristech.co/color-temperature-and-blue-light/)

## What is gamma and what is it for?

At the end of the graphics pipeline, just **where the image leaves the computer** to make its journey along the monitor cable, there is a small piece of hardware that can transform pixel values on the fly. This hardware typically uses a lookup table to transform the pixels. This hardware uses the red, green and blue values that come from the surface to be displayed **to look up gamma-corrected values in the table and then sends the corrected values to the monitor instead of the actual surface values. So, this lookup table is an opportunity to replace any color with any other color.** While the table has that level of power, the typical usage is to tweak images subtly to compensate for differences in the monitor’s response. The monitor’s response is the function that relates the numerical value of the red, green and blue components of a pixel with that pixel’s displayed brightness.

**Sony VAIO**, the [users confirm](http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/color-calibration-keeps-resetting.452666/#post-5782066) that this working :
VAIO Control Center > Display> Color mode setting > Deselect: Change to optimal color mode automatically

**Intel Chipset**, follow the instructions [here](https://www.pipiscrew.com/2018/02/intel-hd-graphics-maintain-color-profile-icc/)

The same can be achieved by ICC profile (windows pure solution)

On TV LED 40' **JVC** [LT40V550](https://www.manualslib.com/manual/1207174/Jvc-Lt-40c755.html?page=20#manual), goto to 'Picture', **restore defaults** by clicking 'Reset', to target 3400K set
Mode: Dynamic (so save the changes you will make to RGB)
Temperature : WARM
Go to Advanced Settings, the RGB should be
**R:** 16 (no modification)
**G:** 10 (suggested 15, but was too yellow, thanks Daniel for the tips!)
**B:** 5
