Privacy-focused browser **Brave** has finished the final phase of a two-stage process and has now migrated most of its userbase to a full Chromium codebase, the same one used by Chrome, Vivaldi, Opera, and soon, Edge (Microsoft is going to remake its Edge desktop browser by using Chromium components and by bringing it to Windows 7, 8.1 and macOS, in addition to Windows 10).
