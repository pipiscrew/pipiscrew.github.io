LAMP Stack, with Apache
LEMP Stack, with nginx

**Apache:**
-Has been available for so many years (since 1995), a lot of users and modules (mostly open-source) written to expand its functionality;
-Process/thread-oriented approach — slows down under heavy load, need to spawn new processes and consuming more RAM, also creates new threads which have to compete for CPU and RAM resources;
-Limit has to be set to ensure that resources are not overloaded, when the limit is reached, additional connections will be refused;
-Limiting factor in tuning Apache: memory and potential to dead-locked threads contending for the same CPU and memory.

**nginx:**
-Open source web server application written to address performance and scalability issues associated with Apache;
-Event-driven, asynchronous and non-blocking approach, doesn’t create new processes for each web request;
-Setting number of worker processes, and each worker can handle thousands of concurrent connections;
-Modules are included at compile time, have internal PHP code compiler (no need for PHP module)
-htaccess not supported

To conclude, nginx is faster and able to handle much higher load compared to Apache using the same set of hardware.
