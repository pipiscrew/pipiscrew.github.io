> The human body is an electrical being. All the cells, tissues and organs in your body communicate with each other via small electrical currents. Dirty electricity perturbs these communications which makes the body vulnerable to disease.
> 
> Studies show that there is a biological impact to electromagnetic pollution. Cell phone towers and cell phones produce one form of this pollution, but dirty electricity produces another. Just as deadly.

 [How Works](https://www.blushield-us.com/blushield-works/?v=445d337b5cd5)  -  [Research](https://www.blushield-us.com/testing/?v=445d337b5cd5)  -  [Overview (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wtWN8M1aR0)  -  [Amazon Reviews](https://www.amazon.com/Protection-Blushield-Protection-Similar-Earthcalm/product-reviews/B00K70OX0Q/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_paging_btm_prev_1?reviewerType=avp_only_reviews&pageNumber=1)  -  [Europe site](https://www.blushield-eu.com)  -  [Global sites](https://www.blushield.global/)  -  [Distributors](https://www.blushield-global.com/distributor/)  -  [Explained](https://www.earthingoz.com.au/blushield)

**EMF** = electromagnetic field **EMR** = electromagnetic radiation **EM** = electromagnetic **EHS** = electromagnetic hypersensitivity **RF** = radiofrequency **MPBST** = mobile phone base station tower **RF-EMFR** = radio-frequency electromagnetic field radiation 

<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">➜</span>Every **EM** wave has a component called the **transverse** wave, and another component called the **longitudinal (scalar)** wave.

**Transverse** waves are the part of the **EMF** that can be measured by meters.

Although **scalar** fields **cannot** be detected by a standard **meter**, they are **readily picked up** by living organisms. All living things produce their own scalar energy (called bio-scalar), and are sensitive to scalar energy in their environment. The Earth is constantly producing a variety of ever-changing scalar fields, which our bodies have evolved with.

The **scalar** component of an electromagnetic field is about **5 times stronger** than the **transverse** component. For example, if your **EMF meter** picks up **100 milligauss**, this is just a reading of the **transverse** wave that emits a measurable frequency, and the **invisible scalar** component will be around **500 milligauss**!

Blushield produces a **scalar** wave carrying a variety of natural, **coherent frequencies** does **not** actually **block** the EMFs in our environment. It simply produces a <strong style="color: red;">competing field** that’s high-powered enough for **our bodies to 'hear'** over the **incoherent EMFs**, and harmonious and natural so our bodies will **“tune in to that radio station”**. The **man-made EMFs** can **continue to run in the background**, nothing changed, **but all living organisms in the range of the Blushield will have adapted to 'listen' to the Blushield frequencies instead of the other**.

When a living organism is exposed to one **repetitive frequency** for a long enough time, the **scalar** component of this single frequency will **hit** the **body’s cells** in the **same way**, over and over, like a **hammer** banging on the **same spot repeatedly**. Over time, with the hammer, the **spot** being hit is going to **break down**. When one frequency **hits the DNA** of the cells in the same way over a long time, this will cause **DNA damage**. From the other side, Blushield conforming to the natural patterns, the **algorithm ensures** the frequency combinations **are never repetitive**.

<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">➜</span>Professor Martin Blank PhD states EMF damages and causes **mutations in DNA**. Mutations in DNA are believed to be the initiating steps in the **development of cancers**. A variety of forces, both internal and external, affects the rate at which DNA damage occurs. When in a Blushield field, the **EMF force is removed**. ([src](https://www.earthingoz.com.au/blushield-frequently-asked-questions/))

<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">➜</span>Interview with [Mark Langdon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark-langdon-3a213315a/) (founder @ NZ) - [https://www.lukestorey.com/lifestylistpodcast/next-level-emf-protection-harmonizing-with-scalar-waves-feat-mark-langdon-198](https://www.lukestorey.com/lifestylistpodcast/next-level-emf-protection-harmonizing-with-scalar-waves-feat-mark-langdon-198)

<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">➜</span>What you have to know -Blood test before and after, for immunology and biomarker inconsistencies in the blood such as white blood cell count, inflammation markers, Rouleaux effect, etc. -Keep a distance of 3 to 4 meters from sleeping places. -The Blushield does not emit any kind of magnetic field or radio frequency so it is safe to use on airplanes and with pacemakers. ([src](https://www.blushield-eu.com/Webwinkel-Page-616945/FAQ.html)) -It can take up to two weeks to fully resonate with the scalar field and the native frequencies. When this time passes, you may notice something as simple as a more peaceful home. Or, as so many of our EHS friends have found, you may find that you no longer experience headaches, tinnitus, or are less depressed. ([src](https://www.blushield-us.com/frequently-asked-questions/?v=445d337b5cd5#1563391632052-5fabbafe-a8aa)) -Most people will experience some tiredness or detox symptoms while initially using this product. This is due to the release of stress on the body from EMF and also boosting the immune system. A detox may present as feeling tired or a metallic taste in the mouth, thirsty and dry mouth, a mild headache, skin eruptions to name but a few. This is a sign the immune system has gained some ground and began to normalise itself. This also tells us the unit is doing its job effectively. It is ideal to drink plenty of water and take some form of vitamin C during this transient time. Once adjusted your body will be acclimatised and no longer detox. Most people don’t experience a detox but notice boundless energy and exceptional emotional stability instead. ([src](https://nikaudigitalstudio.com/emf/))
