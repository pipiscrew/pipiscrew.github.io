Dr Schlundt said there was 'major concern' over the detection of acrylamide at alarming levels in staple products eaten by millions every day. Dr Schlundt, the World Health Organisation's **head** of food safety, said after an emergency meeting in Geneva that teams of scientists in Britain, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Switzerland had confirmed the findings. They have detected acrylamide in foods such as
-fried potatoes
-crisps
-crispbreads
-breakfast cereals

Acrylamide, a human neurotoxicant and rat tumorigen, is **produced in starchy foods when cooked**, levels appear to be highest in foods that have been **cooked at high temperatures** for long periods. The substance has long been linked to many different forms of cancer, nerve damage and infertility, experts had no idea that it could produced by cooking. The 25 experts from universities and food safety authorities around the world who gathered for the three- day talks said further tests on different types of food were now urgently needed.

> It is likely that this is causing cancer in the human population. It is a genotoxic substance, which means it goes into the genes and changes something, and causes cancer. This is something that people will get in their food all the time, over the whole of their lives

said Dr Schlundt, added that he believed a 'significant' proportion of the 30 to 40 per cent of all cancer cases thought to be linked to diet might be caused by acrylamide.

> You should not have a picture that if you eat something once that has acrylamide then you will get cancer tomorrow. The longer you eat it, the greater the risk

Early experiments suggest that boiling does not increase levels of the chemical.

Acrylamide in food appears to be **produced naturally** as a result of **baking or frying**. It is also likely to be produced by **grilling and roasting**.

## McDougall - Acrylamide Poisoning Research (2005)

On June 16, 2005 news warned that a **28gr** serving of **Lay's potato chips** eaten daily **exceeds** safety levels for a recently discovered cancer-causing substance known as **acrylamide**.

**Chips** tested **pose** a risk of **one or two cancers per 1000** people.

The **lowest acrylamide levels among the 12** tested were found in Lay's Light KC Masterpiece BBQ chips, but they **still contained 38 times the amount** that the state considers acceptable.

Consistent with the cliché 'time is money' fast cooking at high temperatures means more profits for companies that are known for their 'fast and convenient foods'. Unfortunately, their methods of frying, baking, roasting, and grilling also put the **consumer at risk**.  Rapid heating to high temperatures of an amino acid, asparagine (found in all foods) in combination with the common sugars (found in plant-foods), results in the **formation of acrylamide**.

Most importantly, acrylamide cannot be detected in unheated and boiled foods (100c), because the minimal temperature to cause this conversion (produce acrylamide) is 120c. Cooking temperatures **above 185c** readily produce acrylamide substance.

Potato chips, manufacturers can reduce (but not eliminate) acrylamide levels by changing how the chips are processed – that is cooking them at lower temperatures and lengthening their cooking times. Even **without** the acrylamide, these greasy chips **still promote cancer** by other well-known mechanisms, such as excess calories, immune-system suppression from vegetable fats, and cellular damage caused by trans-fats.

Acrylamide in food is not the result of contamination from environmental sources, but rather from **heating** foods containing sugars (**carbohydrates**). So cooked **organic** foods would not be expected to be any different than levels in cooked foods that are not organic.

This cancer-causing substance tends to attack the
➜ nervous system
➜ impair fertility
➜ harm genetic material
➜ induce the formation of tumors in experimental animals

Cancers of the 
➜ thyroid gland
➜ female breast tissues
➜ male testicles
➜ mouth are most common

Because acrylamide causes cancer in laboratory animals in high doses, it is considered a potential human carcinogen.

**WHO** estimates, people consume **1 microgram/Kg** of acrylamide a day, the risk of cancer is about **1 in 1000**.
**Stockholm University** research group found **one microgram of acrylamide** in just **0.5gr of potato chips** or **2gr of french fries**. The research group estimates are that **people typically eat an average of 35-40 micrograms per day** of acrylamide.

In general, there is a **10 times difference** in the amount of acrylamide between **normal** cooked and **overcooked** foods.

**Cooking meat produces no acrylamide**, does not mean meat is off the hook as a health hazard.  Cooking meat has been recognized for decades to produce many very **powerful cancer-causing substances** including heterocyclic amines, N-nitroso compounds (nitrosamines) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzopyrene).

Don’t drink coffee since this beverage is made from **roasted beans**. **Tea**, even black tea with caffeine, is made by low-temperature drying processes, not roasting and therefore would have undetectable acrylamide levels.

Do not **damage** your **foods** by **overheating** them. Foods will always be safe with **boiling** and **steaming**, because the maximum temperature reached is only 100c.

Keep the foods **below 120c**. When baking breads or casseroles, using **lower temperatures for longer periods** will produce less acrylamide. Removing the **crust** from commercial breads will also **reduce** acrylamide exposure. 

Focus on the fact that our common cancers, breast, prostate, and colon, are **rare in populations** whose diets are based on cooked starches and vegetables, such as the rice-eating **Japanese**.  These people, living on their traditional diet, enjoy the world’s record for longevity and also have almost **no** heart disease, type-2 diabetes, or obesity.  Obviously, any acrylamide formed in their foods has had no serious impact on their robust lives.

## Scientists determine safe acrylamide levels (2009)

➜ US Toxicology study - Tolerable intakes of acrylamide should be set at **2.6 micrograms per kilogram of body weight** to avoid the cancer risk.
This would be equivalent to (2.6 * 70) **182 micrograms for a 70 kg human** as a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for carcinogenic levels. The TDI for **neurotoxicity** was found to be higher, at 40 micrograms per kg per day, or **2,800 micrograms per day for a 70 kg** human.

➜ Health Canada - Exposure of adults to acrylamide in food to be between **0.3 and 0.4 micrograms per kilogram of body weight** per day (aka 28mg for 70kg).
➜ Sweden study - Exposure of adults to acrylamide in food to be **0.5 micrograms per kilogram of bodyweight** per day (aka 30mg for 70kg).
➜ US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - Estimated intakes to be around **0.4 micrograms per kilogram of bodyweight** per day (aka 28mg for 70kg).

➜ A 2009 study, funded by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), used a state-of-the-art physiologically-based toxicokinetic model to compare doses of **acrylamide and its metabolite glycidamide** in humans and rats. The researchers, led by Robert Tardiff from the Sapphire Group Inc. in Bethesda, Maryland, report their findings in Food and Chemical Toxicology​. [src](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2009.11.048)    -    [mirror](http://docdroid.net/vSAFsvM)

> Overall, we conclude that the TDIs and margins of exposure for average exposures to acrylamide in cooked foods provide an adequate margin of safety to preclude neurotoxicity as well as tumor formation. The certainty in our conclusions is relatively high because of reliance on relying on findings from our updated human internal dosimetry model and a reasonable understanding of acrylamide’s modes of action

## American Cancer Society - Does acrylamide cause cancer? (2019)

For most people, the major potential sources of acrylamide exposure are in certain foods and in cigarette smoke. Avoiding cigarette smoke can lower your exposure to this and other harmful chemicals.

Here are some ways to reduce exposure to acrylamide in foods, according to the FDA:

-Limit foods that might be high in acrylamide, such as potato products (especially French fries and potato chips), coffee, and foods made from <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">grains</span> (such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and toast).
-Limit certain cooking methods, such as frying and roasting, and limit the time certain foods are cooked. Boiling and steaming do not produce acrylamide.
-Soak raw potato slices in water for 15 to 30 minutes before frying or roasting to reduce acrylamide formation during cooking. (Soaked potatoes should be drained and blotted dry before cooking to prevent splattering or fires.)
-If frying potatoes or toasting bread, cook them to a lighter color (as opposed to dark brown), which produces less acrylamide.
-Avoid storing potatoes in the refrigerator, which can result in increased acrylamide levels during cooking.

*   The [International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)](https://www.iarc.fr/index.php) classifies acrylamide as a **“probable human carcinogen.”**

*   The [US National Toxicology Program (NTP)](https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/) has classified acrylamide as **“reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.”** 

*   The [US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)](https://www.epa.gov/) classifies acrylamide as **“likely to be carcinogenic to humans.”**

when asked **wasa.de** (delikatess) for the baking temperature, the reply made on 18/02/2020 was :

> The Wasa crispbread is baked at temperatures of up to approx. 380 ° C.

when acknowledge this page to **wasa.de**, the reply made on 19/02/2020 was :

> In fact, there has been a lot of misinformation and half-truths on the Internet for over 10 years. We naturally observe the topic and the findings in a differentiated manner and are fully aware of the topic.
> 
> Acrylamide is created by a certain type of amino acid (asparagine) and in the reduction of sugar, not only by the baking temperature itself. In the fermentation process, asparagine and sugar are reduced by yeast and / or the natural enzymes and are therefore not accessible to produce acrylamide in the baking process.
> 
> Increased acrylamide values ​​are usually documented for non-fermented bread, which is sometimes sprayed with sugar, which of course does not apply to our products. We use a minimal amount of sugar for fermentation, nothing more.
> 
> The EU limit for acrylamide is 350 ppb (parts per billion). The average value determined by us for our warm bread produced with yeast is 85 ppb, the value for cold bread baked without yeast is on average 160 ppb.

when asked **wasa.se** (whole grain) for the baking temperature, the reply made on 27/02/2020 was :

> The highest temperature is about 500c degrees.

when asked for acrylamide to **wasa.de**, the reply made on 27/02/2020 was :

> Barilla, together with other food manufacturers and researchers, helped to design the CIAA's acrylamide minimization toolbox, which is the tool that the EU Commission and national authorities recommend that the industry use. When Barilla manufactures and develops crispbread products, these recommendations are taken into account to minimize acrylamide levels. Among other things, it has been shown that the fermentation process has a very positive effect in minimizing the acrylamide content in bread products. The majority of Wasa products have very long fermentation times. Wasa crispbread is part of the control program implemented in the EU and Barilla regularly checks for crispbread products so that they contain a lower acrylamide content than the indicative acrylamide content which is the benchmark for the crispbread category.
