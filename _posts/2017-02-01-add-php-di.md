You need to add the PHP directory to your path

### Solution 1 : Needs a batch file

```js
//http://stackoverflow.com/a/2736574

SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\xampp\php
.
.
.your command here
```

### Solution 2 : Permanent

Go to your "system properties" please.then follow as bellow.

Advanced system settings(from left sidebar)->Environment variables(very last option)->path(from lower box/system variables called as I know)->edit

then concatenate the "php" location you have in your pc (usually it is where your xampp is installed say c:/xampp/php)
