```js
FROM debian:stable

WORKDIR /var/www

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install curl
RUN apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install ca-certificates

RUN curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadiener/docker-images-size-benchmark/master/main.go -o main.go

RUN apt-get purge -y curl
RUN apt-get purge -y ca-certificates
RUN apt-get autoremove -y
RUN apt-get clean
```

**Each statement, like RUN, creates a new layer**. In the previous example, at the top of the layers from the Debian image, Docker creates nine extra layers. Layers use space and as the levels increase, the final image size also increases. This is because the system keeps all the changes between the various statements.

It may be a good practice to combine the various instructions in a **single line**. But beware, it’s important to design the Dockerfile to use the layers cache system as much as possible.

<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">after</span>

```js
FROM debian:stable

WORKDIR /var/www

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get -y --no-install-recommends install curl \
        ca-certificates && \
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gadiener/docker-images-size-benchmark/master/main.go -o main.go && \
    apt-get purge -y curl \
        ca-certificates && \
    apt-get autoremove -y && \
    apt-get clean
```

The example above creates just two layers on top of the Debian image instead of nine.
As you can see the last commands used are **apt-get autoremove** and **apt-get clean**. It’s very important to delete temporary files that do not serve the purpose of the image, such as the package manager’s cache. These files increase the size of the final image **without giving any advantage**.
