Deferral options are still available in the Group Policy. Tap on the Windows-key, type gpedit.msc, and hit the Enter-key to launch the Group Policy Editor (professional versions only).

Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Update > Windows Update for Business.

There you find "Select when Preview Builds and Feature Updates are received" and "Select when Quality Updates are received".
