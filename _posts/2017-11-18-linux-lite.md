A delightful, tasteful distro that makes Linux feel like a breath of fresh air. Linux Lite is a distro that finds favour wherever itâ€™s installed, but for some odd reason is often left to one side, or forgotten completely when the talk turns to fresh, lightweight and manageable desktops. Based on **Ubuntu** and uses the **XFCE** desktop environment.
