Is a Canadian documentary film written by Joel Bakan, and directed by Mark Achbar and Jennifer Abbott. The documentary examines the modern-day corporation, considering its legal status as a class of person and evaluating its behavior towards society and the world at large as a psychiatrist might evaluate an ordinary person. This is explored through specific examples. Bakan wrote the book, The Corporation: The Pathological Pursuit of Profit and Power, during the filming of the documentary.

[Synthetic chemicals](https://youtu.be/Y888wVY5hzw?t=1509) (shell / dow) in 1940 mark the begging of a new ERA that give the ability to synthesize and create on unlimited scale new chemicals that never exist before. They got the petroleum molecule or art, and rearrange to â€¦.. you name it (toothbrushes / tires / cosmetics etc.). Suddenly became possible to produce any new synthetic chemical that never existed before, for any purpose, without any cost.
