A picture is worth a thousand of words. But sometimes you still want to add words or other information to the picture. For instance,

-Add name tag to people in the photo, in case you may forget them in the future.
-Display objects with dimension information in the images.
-Add enlarged details for a particular part in the image.

With iPhotoDraw, you can add description text, callout boxes (ballons), dimensions, detailed images, and other annotation objects to the pictures. We don't mess up the original pictures with the annotation. In stead, the annotation is stored in a separated file and the original picture file is intact.
