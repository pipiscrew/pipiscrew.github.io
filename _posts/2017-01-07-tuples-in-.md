Often, we want to return more than one value from a class method. Prior to the introduction of tuples in .NET, there were three common ways to do so. 

-Out parameters
-Class or struct types
-Anonymous types returned through a dynamic return type 

Tuples solve this problem. Tuples arenâ€™t new to C# or .NET. Tuples were first introduced as a part of .NET Framework 4.0.
