I've installed the best-in-breed security software, configured it with the best-in-breed rules and add-ons and analytics tools and staffed it with a best-in-breed SOC using the best-in-breed processes and a Wordpress vulnerability brings down the entire company. Or a misconfigured S3 bucket. Or an employee sending an email or browsing Facebook, or sharing a document.
