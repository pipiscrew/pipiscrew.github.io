-Genetics testing company 23andMe made headlines last week when it announced it would share consumers' anonymized genetic data with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline.

-Companies like 23andMe frequently share customer DNA data with other institutions, also known as "third parties."

-Ancestry, another popular company like 23andMe, had a partnership with Google's stealthy life extension spinoff Calico to study the genetics of longevity. That partnership has now ended.
