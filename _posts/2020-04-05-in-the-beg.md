Can you imagine if something as basic as email worked like that? Can you imagine if Gmail users were restricted to sending emails to other Gmail users? The fact that they are not so restricted is directly attributed to the fact that the protocols involved in sending emails are open standards. Even if you opt for a Gmail account, with your emails ultimately under Google's control, the idea that you couldn't use that account to send emails to someone who uses, say, ProtonMail, is absurd.
