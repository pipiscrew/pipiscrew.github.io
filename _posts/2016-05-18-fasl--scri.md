Is scripting language allows you to easily and comfortably program on your mobile device (e.g. your smartphone or tablet computer).

FASL itself is platform independent with a high level of abstraction. It is tailored for the characteristics of mobile devices like small screens, no hardware keyboard and so on. It is possible to access the features of the mobile device (SMS, contacts, GPS, camera) via an extendible API.
