### How cell processes round up and dump damaged proteins

A very large **protease** called a <strong style='color:#E86549'>proteasome** is responsible for **degrading** the vast majority of **proteins** in a **cell**; it may be **made** up of as many as **40 proteins**.

<strong style='color: #41CD5C'>UCH37 enzyme** is one of the **regulatory** enzymes that **associates** with the <strong style='color:#E86549'>proteasome**. 

What does **ubiquitin protein** do?
The cells in your body build up and break down proteins at a rapid rate. Ubiquitin attaches to proteins, **tagging them for disposal**. Tagged proteins are taken to <strong style='color:#E86549'>proteasomes** to be **destroyed**. Just before the protein enters the proteasome, ubiquitin is disconnected to be used again.

**Ubiquitin protein** in addition to modifying other proteins, modifies itself resulting in a wide array of chains.. Some of these chains can have extensive branching. We found that <strong style='color: #41CD5C'>UCH37** removes branch points from chains, **allowing degradation** to proceed.

> Could eventually lead to a new cancer treatment because cancer cells need the proteasome to grow and proliferate.

Many cancer cells are essentially **addicted** to **proteasome** function, its cells **produce proteins at such a fast rate that mistakes are made**, and if these are not **cleared out**, cells **can't function**. Since <strong style='color: #41CD5C'>UCH37** aids in **clearing out proteins**, it could be a useful therapeutic target to add to the <strong style='color:#E86549'>proteasome** inhibitors that have already been successful in the clinic.

We had to come up with a way to generate a wide variety of **ubiquitin** chains that would represent the potential diversity in a cell. Using that new library of **ubiquitin** chains allowed us to **interrogate** the activity of <strong style='color: #41CD5C'>UCH37** in a controlled setting. That series of experiments gave us the first clue that this **enzyme** was doing something <strong style='color: #41CD5C'>unique**.

> It took us eight years to figure it out, and I'm very proud of this work. We had to develop a lot of new methods and tools to understand what this enzyme is doing.
