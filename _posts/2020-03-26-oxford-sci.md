**Oxford scientists** have discovered a key underlying cause of a range of serious conditions including cancers and Motor Neurone Disease (MND). It's important because if you know why something happens, you can try to do something about it and you are a lot closer to fixing it. So it was overwhelming when Professor Kristijan Ramadan and his team at Oxford's Department of Oncology discovered that a naturally-occurring, but faulty, ‘protein plough’ is linked to a range of very serious conditions.

**Professor Ramadan** explains that, if the body is working properly, proteins swoop in to repair lesions or damage to the DNA. Lesions can occur because of drinking, smoking, during illness or because of medicines.

what his team discovered is that a **protein** called **Topoisomerase 1**, which comes in to **repair damage** to the DNA, can **become toxic**, if it **sticks** (covalent attachment) to the DNA.

* * *

**TEX264** is an endoplasmic reticulum (aka ER) transmembrane protein
**TEX264** acts as a major **receptor** for autophagic degradation of the ER (aka ER-phagy)

* * *

The body has its own little ‘protein plough’ which should **remove** proteins before they become a **problem**. In more complex terms, specialized DNA repair machinery composed of the :

*   p97 ATPase

*   SPRTN protease (protein plough)

*   autophagy receptor TEX264

should **tackle** the linked protein-DNA **toxic** product.

Professor Ramadan explains, the protein must be **transitory** only, if it remains on the **surface** of the DNA for too **long**, it can become **entangled**, difficult to **remove**, and potentially **toxic**. Problems **arise**, if the body’s **natural plough** does not **clear** away the **protein** (or if it clears away proteins **too rapidly** before they have a chance to repair the lesion).

The **implications** are potentially **immense**. Pathological **accumulation** of the **protein**, also known as **Topoisomerase 1-cleavage-complex (Top1cc)**, is linked both to **neurodegeneration** and **cancer**. Faulty ‘protein ploughs’ can **cause** or **undermine** treatment for **cancers** and lead to **debilitating conditions** such as Motor Neurone Disease (ALS), and even to premature ageing. In the case of some cancers, the super-functional ‘protein plough’ can **undermine chemotherapy treatment,** by **clearing** it away from the **DNA** before it can be **effective**. Chemotherapy prevents cancer cells replicating. If it is **cleared** away, by an over-zealous **plough**, the **cancer treatment** will be **ineffective** and there is much greater possibility of **metastases**.
