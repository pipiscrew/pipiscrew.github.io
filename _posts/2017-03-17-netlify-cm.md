A CMS for Static Site Generators

Is an open-source React app that acts as a wrapper for the Git workflow, using the GitHub API. This allows collaborators to create, edit, review, and publish content without writing code or dealing with version control, and it allows developers to manage this content with familiar build tools and the convenience of Git.
