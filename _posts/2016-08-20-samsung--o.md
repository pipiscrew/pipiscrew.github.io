> Over the last 6 months or so, it’s picked up a quirk where it randomly drops the signal and starts to overheat in my pocket. Only toggling in and out of airplane mode to restart the connection solves the problem.

> when Google updates Android, manufacturers update their firmware along with it

> Updating your modem firmware doesn’t touch the rest of the operating system, and it doesn’t touch your data. It’s always a good idea to take a backup, but this is not a high risk operation for your data.

> The updated firmware file is a .tar file, which contains two .bin files: modem.bin for the 3g modem in your phone, and NON-HLOS.bin for the LTE modem in your phone. You’ll need both. Apparently if you’re on Windows you can use Odin which will let you send both those .bin files at once by choosing the combined .tar file.

> Odin has the ability to restore the partition table using .pit file which contains the partition information of the device.

> In some cases, installing the stock firmware might result in a boot loop. It means that when the device reboots automatically, it’s unable to get past the Samsung logo animation. If your device is stuck on the boot animation, or if you are facing overheating, battery drain, lag or slow performance or some other misbehavior, we recommend performing a data/factory reset via the stock recovery.

## com.android.phone has stopped after dirty flashing CM13

http://android.stackexchange.com/questions/129886/com-android-phone-has-stopped-after-dirty-flashing-cm13

**solution 1**
The culprit seems to be broken database onUpgrade code in the TelephonyProvider of CM. The ppp_number column of the carriers table does not exists, but the upgrade code assumes it already exists.

I solved it by copying the telephony.db to my local Linux machine and reverting the database version to version.

**solution 2**
I removed these two directories

```js
/data/user/0/com.android.providers.telephony
/data/data/com.android.phone/
```

completely, make sure to **reboot** the device after deleting those directories.
