Curry powder is a British invention, powder isn’t Indian… it’s just a pre-made spice mix that includes “Indian” spices like coriander, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, etc. <span style="color: #ff0000;">**Curry powder does not contain curry leaves**</span>.

I do not recommend buying dried curry leaves – they don’t taste anywhere as good as the fresh stuff.

### What Are Fresh Curry Leaves?

Native to southern Asia, curry leaf is an herb that comes from a tree — it's used in a lot of East Indian food.

Fresh curry leaves look like small, shiny lemon leaves, and smell pungently of curry. You can keep them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to two weeks or freeze them. While dried curry leaves are also available, they have less aroma and flavor.

### Are Curry Leaves Related to Curry Powder?

While curry leaves do have a flavor reminiscent of curry powder, they have nothing to do with curry powder. **Curry powder is a blend of other** dried, ground spices, herbs, and seeds. **Most of time using Turmeric** (aka Kurkuma/Κουρκούμη), a **bright yellow** aromatic powder obtained from the **rhizome of a plant of the ginger family**.
