Is an application for capturing screen activity in the form of AVI video or bitmap images.

Beside the usual options defining the capture area, AviScreen has a unique feature called follow the cursor. Using this mode you can produce a video or image of relatively small dimensions while covering all mouse activity over the whole screen area.
