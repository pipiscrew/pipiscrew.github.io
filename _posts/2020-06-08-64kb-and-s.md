Demos are special computer programs. They are beautiful presentations made by talented people - programmers, graphics, musicians - just for fun. This is real electronic art. Size-limited demos are called intros, and there are some categories of them - we have intros in 64 kilobytes, 4 kilobytes, even in 256 bytes and less. It's wonderful that some people make very impressive effects in so tiny space.
