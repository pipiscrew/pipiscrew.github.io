American and Irish liquor producers (and copy editors) tend to favor the spelling WHISKEY, while Canadian, Scottish, and Japanese producers (and copy editors) tend to favor (or should I say, favour) WHISKY.

Countries that have E’s in their names (UnitEd StatEs and IrEland) tend to spell it **whiskEy** (plural **whiskeys**)

Countries without E’s in their names (Canada, Scotland, and Japan) spell it **whisky** (plural **whiskies**)

## Malt vs Blended 

Blended - A mixture of two or more whiskies that are bottled and sold as one whisky. Formally, however, a blended whisky is a product that contains a mix of barrel-aged malt and grain whiskies.
Sngle-malt whisky is nothing more or less than the product of a single distillery.
