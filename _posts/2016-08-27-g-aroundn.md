Google’s wildcard search operator, represented by Asterisk (hot * springs), may achieve similar results   but with AROUND, you even get to specify the distance between the two search terms.

If we modify the query to look like "hot AROUND(5) springs," you get results where the two terms are written on the page in close proximity.

This operator is particularly helpful in long articles or long text, for example searching Google books. It is also helpful for when searching for quotes, speeches or a song that’s stuck in your head, but you can only think of a few words from it.
