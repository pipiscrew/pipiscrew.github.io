When a new title releases, game crackers rush to see if they can break the game's files and acquire the title completely free. Crackers then proceed to upload that file to private servers to let the public also download the title for free. Instructions for cracking the game are usually provided in this download as well. Now, Bethesda has just released DOOM Eternal, and the Steam version of the game uses Denuvo anti-tamper tech to stop crackers.
