everyday getting a 150mb mySQL dump file (exported by phpmyadmin), contains a logs table with 28k rows kai 20fields, needed to cut out the table from this file. 

to accomplish this we have to

find the line number of first occurrence (aka the line that writes the table name) :
-- Table structure for table `logs`

find the line number of first occurrence of next table name (aka the line that writes the table name) :
-- Table structure for table `next_table`

save this to **test.sh** with your favorite text editor
```js
#!/bin/bash
#https://stackoverflow.com/a/10885460
startno=$(grep -m 1 -nr "platformlogs" source.sql | cut -f1 -d:)
endno=$(grep -m 1 -nr "\`platformroles\`" source.sql | cut -f1 -d:)

#https://stackoverflow.com/a/5683408
sed -n "$startno,$endno w source_cleaned.sql" source.sql
```

* * *

sample2:
```js
#!/bin/bash
#https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/sed-howto-remove-lines-paragraphs/
sed '/platformlogs/,/\`platformroles\`/d' source.sql > source_cleaned.sql
```

* * *

```js
#to make it runnable, execute :
chmod u+x test.sh

#execute it with :
./test.sh
```

the dump file
before : 147mb
after : 7.6mb
