An American was the first person to cross Antarctica alone and without help. He needed 54 days.

On Wednesday, 33-year-old Colin O'Brady reached his destination on the Ross Ice Shelf. He had covered about 1500 kilometers on skis within 54 days through freezing cold. O'Brady had pulled his luggage behind him on a sled. He didn't mention a wall.
