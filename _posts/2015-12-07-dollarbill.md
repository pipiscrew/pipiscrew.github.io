Is a microjs library that implements simple methods to accomplish tasks using the same names and signatures featured in jQuery. Unlike jQuery, which weighs a little over 91kb minified, DollarBill is around <strong style="color: red;">8kb**. DollarBill is NOT compatible with outdated browsers, but does work with all modern browsers including Internet Explorer 10+, Chrome, FireFox and Safari.
