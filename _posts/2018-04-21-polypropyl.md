The melting point is approximately 120 degrees Celsius (320 degrees Fahrenheit) so it shouldn’t be too much of an issue for most individual scenarios. Is an extremely durable material and will last you indefinitely if cared for properly on a regular basis. Ideally, it should be hand washed in cold water or machine washed in cold water on the delicate cycle with the polypropylene item turned inside out. Because of the melting factor, it’s recommended to air dry polypropylene. This won’t take too long because of polypropylene resistance to water. If you must use a dryer, ensure the dryer is set to its lowest heat setting and not for more than a few minutes. Polypropylene is color fast so if you get it in some color other than black, it won’t fade. Most manufactures treat their polypropylene with an anti-microbial agent which helps the material resist mildew, stains, and soils. Make sure you take the few minutes it requires to regularly clean your polypropylene gear and it’ll be available to you for years to come!
