Tag folders and files (including multimedia) by dragging the tags on them, you can create tags of various shapes and colors for a more intuitive classification.

Precise search possibilities, with various input fields, allowing to add all the necessary tags that you want. For example, in one field you can add the tags â€˜cat' and 'white' and in another field you can add the tags 'dog' and 'brown', so the search result will return all white cats and brown dogs. You can also indicate that the folders where they are must have certain tags.
