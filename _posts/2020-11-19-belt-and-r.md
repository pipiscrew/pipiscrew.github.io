The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI, or B&R) and formerly known as **One Belt One Road** (OBOR).

The Chinese government calls the initiative "*a bid to enhance regional connectivity and embrace a brighter future*". Some observers see it as a push for Chinese dominance in global affairs with a China-centered trading network. The project has a targeted completion date of **2049**, which coincides with the 100th anniversary of the People's Republic of China.
