Non-admin users cannot run (or even see) **scheduled tasks** created by users with admin rights. 
**Task Scheduler**, when no admin, gives - Error Value: **2147943785**

Solution 1
Scheduled tasks are saved in C:\Windows\System32\Tasks folder as xml files (with no extension). To allow non-admin users to view and run a task, find the task(s) in question and change permissions to allow Read and execute for your chosen user or group (as you would for any other file or directory).
