I would like to explain IMAP Push. When setup an **IMAP** account by default the 

Account > Settings > Fetching mail > Push folder 

is activated.

This option is only available for **IMAP** accounts. When it is enabled a **long-lived connection** to the IMAP server is **established** so K-9 Mail can be notified by the server when a new message has arrived. When this is set, you do not need to select a poll frequency, because you **do not poll**.  [src](https://www.skynetbb.com/k9-mail)

You can disable this by setting the Push folders to none. Then you have to set the 

Account > Settings > Fetching mail > Folder poll frequency

example to every hour.

but seems that this occurring

**IMAP Push**

It should reduce the time and effort needed to synchronize messages between the two by using an open connection that is kept alive by some kind of heartbeat. To **reduce necessary bandwidt**h, it uses compression and command macros. Additionally, P-IMAP features a mechanism for sending email that is derived from (but not identical to) SMTP, and so a rich email service is provided using a single connection.

?? most mobile email apps don't support IMAP IDLE (push) because of the battery hit that it causes. 

I have used K-9 in the past but moved to [AquaMail](https://www.aqua-mail.com/) (not open source) more recently which does IMAP-IDLE/push as well.
