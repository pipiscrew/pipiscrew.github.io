WCF Data Services (formerly ADO.NET Data Services,) is a platform for what Microsoft calls Data Services. It is actually a combination of the runtime and a web service through which the services are exposed. WCF Data Services exposes data, represented as Entity Data Model (EDM) objects, via web services accessed over HTTP.
