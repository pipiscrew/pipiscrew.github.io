Celsius/centigrade scale in use today, but it was interchangeably referred to as either Celsius or centigrade in different regions of the world. The two terms **refer to the same scale of measurement**, and both use the same degree designation (degrees C).

Only a few countries use **Fahrenheit** as their official scale: 
-the United States
-Belize
-Palau
-Bahamas
-Cayman Islands

The relationship between Celsius, C, and Fahrenheit, F, temperatures is given by the following formula:
```jsF = (1.8 x C) + 32```

Freezing point (zero degrees Celsius) is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, and the boiling point at **100 degrees Celsius** is **212 degrees Fahrenheit**.
When the temperature is **-40 degrees**, it is the same in both Celsius and Fahrenheit.
