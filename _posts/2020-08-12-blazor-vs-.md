NET Core (3.1). The true first release of Blazor â€” or to be more specific, Blazor WebAssembly, the technology that lets C# run in a WebBrowser.

Blazor is also a framework that enables you to build client web applications that run in the browser, but using C# instead of TypeScript.

When you create a new Blazor app it arrives with a few carefully selected packages (the essentials needed to make everything work) and you can install additional packages using NuGet.

From here, you build your app as a series of components, using the Razor markup language, with your UI logic written using C#.

The browser can't run C# code directly, so just like the Angular AOT approach you'll lean on the C# compiler to compile your C# and Razor code into a series of .dll files.

To publish your app, you can use dot net's built-in publish command, which bundles up your application into a number of files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript and DLLs), which can then be published to any web server that can serve static files.

When a user accesses your Blazor WASM application, a Blazor JavaScript file takes over, which downloads the .NET runtime, your application and its dependencies before running your app using WebAssembly.

Blazor then takes care of updating the DOM, rendering elements and forwarding events (such as button clicks) to your application code.
