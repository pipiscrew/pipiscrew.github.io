Distilled Water vs Filtered Water vs Bottled - "The Truth" The Journey of Water Documentary

The amazing discovery I am about to unfold to you had its beginning some 40 years ago. Just why I did not receive the impact then I will never know. A few short months ago the truth finally revealed itself to me. At first I found it difficult be comprehend, but little by little the facts began to blend until I saw it all in its entirety, and The Choice Was Clear.

<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span class="a">THE CHOICE IS CLEAR </span><span class="a">by Dr. Allen E. Banik (Dec 1, 1991)</span></span>

**Only One Possible Cause For All Aging Diseases?** Imagine one common possible cause for nearly all diseases! Can it be that arthritis, kidney stones, gall stones, arteriosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), enlarged hearts, emphysema, obesity, constipation, cataracts, glaucoma, diabetes, all stem from one common cause? Unbelievable! But possibly very true!

**Can This Be True?** We all use it every day-from the baby's first cry to the old man's last breath. Water! The one element you need the most and suspect the least. If this shocks you, do not be surprised, as millions of Americans are still unaware of this "aging process," and indulge in it freely. Multitudes suffer from all the above diseases, and unknowingly contribute to this cause daily. Somehow the shots, pills, vitamin capsules and balanced diets add only brief spurts to well-being.
The arthritis can get a little worse, the arteries a little harder, the gall stones and kidney stones a little larger, the eyes a little dimmer, the hearing more complex, sugar starts to appear in the urine, digestion slows down, constipation calls for stronger laxatives-and waist lines get a little larger. It's a never-ending cycle of feeling just a little worse than the day before.

**The Greatest Function Of Distilled Water** Distilled water acts as a solvent in the body. It dissolves food substances so they can be assimilated and taken into every cell. It dissolves inorganic mineral substances lodged in tissues of the body so that such substances can be eliminated in the process of purifying the body.
Distilled water is the greatest solvent on earth-the only one that can be taken into the body without damage to the tissues.
By its continued use, it is possible to dissolve inorganic minerals, acid crystals, and all the other waste products of the body without injuring tissues.

**Water Is Never The Same** True, our officials inspect and test our city water periodically, but water is never the same at all times, neither are wells in the same locations. Water can vary every day. Sometimes chemicals in water can become excessive; at other times negligible; but at all times the minerals will be there. We are looking for a mineral free and chemical-free water. This is the only kind of water our bodies demand. Only through the process of distillation can we achieve this purity.

**Water: A Carrier Of Disease, since water is a carrier of minerals and chemicals, lets list some of them found in our water:**

> Chlorine                               Copper
> Sodium                                 Zinc
> Magnesium                           Lead
> Sulphur                                 Selenium
> Calcium                                Cesium
> Potassium                             Uranium
> Bromine                                Molybdenum
> Carbon                                 Thorium
> Strontium                              Cerium
> Boron                                   Silver
> Silicon                                   Vanadium
> Fluorine                                 Lanthanum
> Nitrogen                                Yttrium
> Aluminum                              Nickel
> Rubidium                               Scandium
> Lithium                                  Mercury
> Phosphorus                           Gold
> Barium                                  Radium
> Iodine                                   Cadmium
> Arsenic                                 Chrome
> Iron                                      Cobalt
> Manganese                           Tin

Our bodies need many of the above-mentioned elements, but only in their organic state. They must first pass through the roots of our plants before our bodies can assimilate them. Herein lies the big error. Nature has a tremendous distilling plant. As the vapors rise. all impurities are left behind. Only as the clouds recondense the water does it again pick up the elements left behind. Now it becomes harmful to us, but beneficial to plants. There is a big difference between powdered iron filings and the iron found in plants. It takes no chemist to tell the difference.

**It's Time To Become Alarmed**
We do not know from day to day just what pollutions may exist in our own water. There is, however, one way to be sure, and that is to distill your own water. You are then sure that you will get the purest water possible.

> Nestlé has been preparing for water shortages for decades

> Towns in Oregon, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin have turned away Nestlé. In Washington, the mayor of Waitsburg, Walt Gobel, resigned last year after it was revealed that he’d conducted secret talks with the company about building a $50 million plant.

> The case dragged on for eight years, Nestlé would reduce pumping from 400 gallons (1515lt) per minute to 218 gallons (825lt)

> We took a bus here from Flint because we’re tired of bottled water, tired of Nestlé, tired of them making a profit off of our disaster.

> Beginning in 2014 thousands of families were exposed to dangerous levels of lead and bacteria in tap water.

> Nestlé even teamed up with Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi to donate 35,000 bottles per month to Flint residents...

> Between 2005 and 2016, Nestlé has taken over 4 billion gallons of our water for pennies and sold it back to us for huge profits
