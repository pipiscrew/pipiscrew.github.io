Have you ever wanted to copy some text from a dialog box which doesnâ€™t provide such functionality?
Textify was created to solve this problem: you can point your mouse over the text, click on the mouse shortcut (Shift + Middle click by default), and get a selectable view of the text.
The tool can be launched with a hidden window by using the -hidewnd command line switch.
