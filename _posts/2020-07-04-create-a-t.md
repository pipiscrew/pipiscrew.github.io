```js
//output folder = 68mb
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release --self-contained```
The above command builds the app in release mode and publishes the self-contained app. This will create a folder with the application .exe and other dependencies. 

Introduces a flag called PublishSingleFile which produces a single .exe file
```js
//output folder = 68mb
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

A new flag called PublishTrimmed which doesn’t include DLL’s that aren’t used to reduced the size. You need to use both the flags together to create a Trimmed Self-Contained Single Executable in .NET Core 3.0.
```js
//output folder = 29mb
dotnet publish -r win-x64 -c Release /p:PublishSingleFile=true /p:PublishTrimmed=true
```
