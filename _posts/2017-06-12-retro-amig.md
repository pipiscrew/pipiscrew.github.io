> Google emulates 1980s-era Amiga computer in Chrome
> Google's Portable Native Client technology gives a new Web-based lease on life for an old operating system and the games it could run

Google developer Christian Stefansen resurrected a version of the venerable computer system from the 1980s in the form of a Web app that runs in Chrome. Forty-year-olds who want to relive their childhoods or younger people who want to see just how hard their elders had it can visit the Amiga 500 emulator for Chrome online, boot the machine, and play some games.
