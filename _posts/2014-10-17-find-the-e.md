```js
	$month=10; //october
	$year = date('Y'); //this year

	$month_calc = $month+1; //increase by 1
	$start_date = date("$year-$month_calc-01"); //convert to date
	$mod_date = strtotime($start_date."- 1 day"); //subtract -1!
	$m = date("Y-m-d",$mod_date); //format back to mysql style!

	//construct the query string!
	$where = " date_start BETWEEN '$year-$month-01' AND '$m'";
