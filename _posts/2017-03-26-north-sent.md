In the late 1800s, they found and captured six Sentinelese people and brought them back to Port Blair in India to learn more about them. After a short time, the prisoners became sick and two of them died. This resulted because they did not have the immunities to fight off common infections of the modern world. The British took the remaining captives back to the island and released them back to their people with bundles of gifts.
