**John's Background Switcher**

I can’t stand plain, boring backgrounds. John’s Background Switcher (or JBS for short) periodically changes the background image on your Windows computer to something awesome. Support for change wallpaper on primary or secondary monitor only every x time! (where windows cant!)

You can specify which pictures to choose from:
-Folders containing pictures on your computer such as ‘My Pictures’ or Dropbox!
-Any Media RSS feed
or Flickr / Facebook / Instagram / Vladstudio / 500px / Phanfare / smugmug / Picasa / Google Image Search / Pixabay / Last.fm
