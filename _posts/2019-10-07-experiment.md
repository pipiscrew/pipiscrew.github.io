To give it a try, download Chrome Canary and enter **chrome://flags/** in the address bar. Search for '**Enable removing SameSite=None cookies**' and set the drop-down menu to 'Enabled'. 

Restart the browser, then enter chrome://settings/siteData in the address bar to access the full list of cookies, and click the new 'Remove third-party cookies' button to erase them.

The way the cookie crumbles
We recently saw another experimental Chrome feature that will let you block third-party cookies completely with the click of a button, but it's good to see that Google is giving us granular control over how (and if) our activity is tracked.

Firefox now blocks all third-party tracking cookies by default, but understandably for a company funded largely by advertising, Google isn't keen to take such drastic action. It recently proposed an idea for a 'privacy sandbox', which would allow advertisers to serve targeted ads without receiving detailed information about an individual user's browsing habits.
