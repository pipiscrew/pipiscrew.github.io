Researchers with Stanford University have published a study revealing that physical aging is not a smooth process, but rather something that happens in what they describe as a ‘herky-jerky trajectory.’ Using blood tests to look at specific proteins, the researchers found that human aging involves three distinct turning points, the first starting in one’s mid-thirties. The study involved blood plasma from more than 4,200 people ages 18 through 95. Based on their analysis of protein changes, the researchers found that humans experience multiple ‘distinct times’ when protein levels experience pronounced ‘changes in abundance,’ something found to happen at around the ages of **34, 60, and 78 years**.
