When Steve Jobs introduced the very first iPhone in 2007, he spoke of how developers would be able to create amazing apps for the iPhone, using only web technologies. **There was no App Store** yet at that time and no notion of native apps. What Jobs envisioned is the concept we now know as Progressive Web Apps, basically websites that have an app-like behavior and are able to work offline. **Unfortunately** that idea never took off and a couple of **months later the App Store was launched**. **Developers now had to use a native SDK** to build an app for the iPhone.
