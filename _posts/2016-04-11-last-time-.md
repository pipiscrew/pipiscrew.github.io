Peg Solitaire is a board game for one player involving movement of pegs on a board with holes. The game is known simply as Solitaire in the UK where the card game are called Patience. It is also referred to as Brainvita. The first evidence of the game can be traced back to the court of Louis XIV, and the specific date of 1697, with an engraving made by that year Claude Auguste Berry of Soubise, with the puzzle by her side. The August, 1697 edition of the French literay magazine Mercure glant contains a description of the board, rules and sample problems. This is the first known reference to the game in print. The standard game fills the entire board with pegs except for the central hole. The objective is, making valid moves, to empty the entire board except for a solitary peg in the central hole.
