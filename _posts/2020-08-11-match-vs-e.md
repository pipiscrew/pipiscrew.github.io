2018 - Does give you access to a free trial that allows you to create your profile, upload your photos, finish your personality matching questionnaire, and read through the profiles of some of your potential matches. It does not let you see their photos or send them any messages without upgrading.

If you want to use eHarmony to start chatting with people and finding that special someone, you are going to have to pay for an upgraded account. While this might not sound ideal, the fact that you have to pay does weed out the people who are not serious. The quality of people that youâ€™ll see on a paid site is much, much higher. Trust me, eHarmony vs. somewhere like Plenty of Fish will be a WILDLY different experience.

One thing you can do to get some communication for free is create your free trial account and then wait for one of their free communication weekends. These are randomly placed throughout the year and open up the ability to start interacting with matches for free for a weekend. If your profile is already set up and ready to go, you can take full advantage of these and see if you m,,hbhjhgjhgjhgjhgjhgaybe want to upgrade after that.
