TheDoctorWho said :
Just as the 5G mmWaves are attracted to rain and plants (due to their moisture content) these waves will be attracted to our 2 to 4 million sweat glands and to our eyes, nose and mouth. This is an exponential increase over what we have been subjected to before with a million units being installed by various companies. What are the health effects on crops? What about our eyes? Sinus problems are one of the leading reasons patients see their doctors. What about the effect there?

Where are the INDEPENDENT studies that PROVE our food supply won't be negatively affected before we jump headlong into this brave new world? Bee keepers have shown if they place a smart phone near their bee hives, the bees stay away. About 40% of our produce relies on bees.

How do thousands of birds not bump into each other when they fly together in mass shifting formations? What happens if their built in electronic sensory abilities are disrupted? What happens to their migration abilities?

Our skin absorbs 85% and we breathe in 15% of the negative ions that we get from the air. Positive ions can be measured from cell towers today. Those positive ions neutralize the negative oxygen ions around them, leaving fewer negative ions to be absorbed by people, plants and animals. A waterfall like Niagara produces 100,000 negative ions per cc per second. An office filled with electronic devices can register at 0 to 50 negative ions per cc. There is a reason why people say they are going to the beach or the forest to "recharge their batteries."
