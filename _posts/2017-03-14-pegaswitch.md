Is an exploit toolkit for the Nintendo Switch. By taking over WebKit, we are able to read/write memory, call native functions, and otherwise explore the functionality of the Switch from the domain of the WebKit process. This does not currently enable homebrew software, but is built to allow other hackers to work toward that goal.
