Indications are that pasta originated from China, **although** there is evidence of pasta use in **Italy** during the Etruscan civilization (several centuries BC). The earliest written record referring to pasta was in **1279**.

**Durum wheat** pasta is considered a **healthy food** being relatively low in fat, high in carbohydrate, and having good protein content. High-protein flours (soybean, pea, lupin,and chickpea) can be added to increase the protein content of pasta. To increase the content of minerals, vitamins, and dietary fiber, incorporation of buckwheat, whole wheat, artichoke, and amaranth pastas all claim health benefits.

Durum wheat is the second most cultivated species of wheat after common wheat, although it only represents 5% to 8% of global wheat production. ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durum))

Several studies have suggested that pasta reduces the **increase** in **blood glucose** in humans following a meal compared to an equivalent load of other carbohydrates, such as white bread. This is considered beneficial in reducing the risk of developing **type II diabetes**.

The typical yield for the complete process from milling to pasta is as follows: **140 kg** of durum wheat produces **95-105 kg** of semolina, **100 kg** of semolina produces **98.5 kg** of pasta. There are three different types of drying temperature used:

**<span style="color: #ff0000;">low </span>temperature** drying at 50c for 18 h
**high temperature** drying at 60-75c for 8h
<span style="color: #ff6600;">**ultrahigh**</span> **temperature** drying at 85-105c for 4-5h ([src](http://www.professionalpasta.it/drying-pasta-at-low-temperature-in-air-flow/))

**Ultrahigh** temperature drying has become <span style="color: #ff6600;">**common**</span> with benefits to quality such as increased pasta firmness.

The feed holes of the die inserts are usually <span style="color: #99cc00;">**teflon** </span>coated to produce pasta with a **smooth surface** while <span style="color: #99cc00;">**bronze** </span>inserts are used to achieve a **rougher pasta surface**, which helps **sauces to stick better** to the cooked pasta.

The **<span style="color: #99cc00;">bronze</span>** drawing ends in a slow drying process of the pasta, which occurs at **<span style="color: #ff0000;">low </span>temperatures**. This step, although it **lengthens the production time**, **guarantees** the pasta to **preserve** all the main **nutritive substances** of the wheat. It is precisely the wheat, in fact, that gives it a full-bodied and decisive flavor. (ex [Sgambaro.Grano Duro Integrale Spaghetti](http://www.sgambaro.it/acquista-online/))
