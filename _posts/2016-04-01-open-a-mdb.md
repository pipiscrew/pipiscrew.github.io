while trying to install, you get a message that tells -> you have to uninstall office! thats great microsoft!
2-use the following DOS command :
```js
AccessDatabaseEngine_X64.exe /passive
```

on your program, the connection string, should be :

## Solution 2 - Add ODBC (file DSN) to MDB (x64)

This problem can occur because of a architecture problem (32-bit office running on 64-bit windows).

The following steps can be used to solve this problem:

1. Navigate to "C:\Windows\SysWOW64"
2. Find "odbcad32.exe", right click on it and do "Run As Administrator"
3. Then continue following the steps listed in the Database Toolbox Guide.

After following the above steps, you will be able to see all the data sources.
