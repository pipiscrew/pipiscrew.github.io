Propolis, referred to as bee glue, is produced by bees in the construction and maintenance of their hives. Bees produce propolis using a combination of beeswax and saliva, where it acts as the defence mechanism for the hive.

Whether the propolis extract was prepared with ethanol or water also changes the constituent nutrient profile.

According to the **HPLC** (High Performance Liquid <u>Chromatography</u>) analysis, the phenolic content of propolis is mainly composed of crysin, galangin, pinostrobin, pinobanksin and pinocembrin, the last being the most abundant ﬂavonoid in propolis. European and Asian propolis contain simple phenolic acids while lignans are the main compounds in propolis from warmer climates (Brazil).

A study of New Zealand propolis found 70% of the ﬂavonoid content was pinobanksin and pinocembrin, much higher than samples from Brazil, Uruguay and China.

Once the propolis phenols reach the blood stream, their selective permeability across the blood–brain barrier and systemic elimination limit the therapeutic efficacy with regards to optimal brain function. However, increasing evidence suggests certain propolis derivatives are capable of **crossing the blood–brain barrier**. Cafeic acid phenethyl ester (**CAPE**) is hydrolysed to cafeic acid within six hours of reaching the plasma and CAPE has recently been shown to cross the blood brain barrier at least in rats. The [chemical name of CAPE](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4058104/) is 2-phenylethyl (2E)-3-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)acrylate. It is also termed as phenylethyl **caffeate** or phenethyl caffeate.

A safe dose of propolis has been reported to be 70 mg/day. As the phenolic compounds present within propolis vary based on geographical origin, the bioactivities will also vary significantly making it difficult to define a correct dosage.

The antioxidant activity of propolis and its constituents has been well documented, with the vast majority of outcomes demonstrating a reduction in oxidative stress markers. The chemical structure of the constituent polyphenols enable propolis to effectively eliminate free radicals. The ﬂavonoids in propolis are powerful antioxidants, capable of scavenging free radicals and thereby protecting the cell membrane against lipid peroxidation.

The most important organ of the central nervous system, the brain, is more sensitive to free radical-induced damage because of its high use of oxygen, its high concentration of polyunsaturated fatty acids, and its low concentration of antioxidant molecules compared to other tissues. In the brain, oxidative stress results in acute and chronic injury and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neuronal damage. Propolis and its derivatives appear to prevent oxidative stress in radiation-injured brain tissue by decreasing the formation of lipid peroxidation and increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities, and also by inhibiting free radical generation. These results suggest an important role of propolis and its constituents as an antioxidant and free radical scavenger on the oxidative stress in the radiation-injured brain tissue. Preclinical studies have also suggested that pinocembrin, a component of propolis, protects rat brain against oxidation and apoptosis induced by ischemia-reperfusion both in vivo and in vitro.

Oxidative stress is a well-known cause of persistent chronic inﬂammation due to its ability to activate transcription factors such as nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB), activator protein 1, tumour protein, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). NF-κB is a protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA and is involved in cellular responses to stimuli such as stress, cytokines, free radicals, ultraviolet irradiation, oxidised low density lipoproteins (LDL) and bacterial or viral antigens. Propolis is able to activate the Nrf2 transcription factor which is a major regulator of antioxidant proteins. The binding of Nrf2 to the antioxidant response element leads to transcription of several antioxidant enzymes, including heme oxygenase-1, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of γ-glutamate-cysteine ligase, GPx, glutathione reductase, CAT, SOD and glutathione-S-transferase.

Inﬂammation is defined as an interaction between the immune system and injured tissues designed to restore homeostasis via complex signalling pathways. The anti-inﬂammatory activity of propolis appear related to its associated constituents: ﬂavonoids, phenolic acids and their esters, terpenoids, steroids and amino acids, with CAPE being the most studied compound.

Traumatic neural dysfunction such as ischemia and epilepsy, or degenerative dysfunction, such as Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease and multiple sclerosis, have had propolis interventions. The mechanisms and causes of neurological dysfunction remain elusive, however they appear linked to an increase in oxidative stress, induction of inﬂammatory signalling and slow immune responses in the brain tissue. While the general antioxidant activity of propolis has been discussed, here we focus on the protective properties towards neurons and related physiology.

Pinocembrin treatment of neuronal cells inhibited the increase of gene and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic gene (bax) following glutamate exposure, without affecting gene and protein expression of the anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2. Bcl-2 gene and protein expression were not altered before and after glutamate insults, which was consistent with previous research. Pinocembrin provides neuroprotection, in part, by inhibiting the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and by downregulating the synthesis of pro-apoptotic Bax, this action may be due to the inhibition of p53 expression.

Alongside the research on neuronal disease, increasingly a focus on the protective effects of propolis on retinal cells is being reported. Propolis has neuroprotective effects both against in vitro retinal damage in cell cultures, studied using induced oxidative damage and neurotoxicity in retinal cell culture, and against retinal damage in mice.

All propolis types, irrespective of origin and consequently the compounds they contain, have shown microbial activity indicating it is rather the collective of propolis compounds rather than the individual compounds that result in its antimicrobial activity. Compounds within propolis appear to prevent bacterial cell division and cause dysfunction within the cytoplasm, thereby inactivating bacterial activity and growth. Propolis has demonstrated various antibacterial activity against a range of pathogens including Bifidobacterium infantis, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Helicobacter pylori, Listeria monocytogene, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, P. larvae, Staphylococcus aureaus, Staphylococcus epidermides, Streptococcus pyogenes and Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium.

The ﬂavonoid constituents of propolis are associated with antibacterial activity, the prominent ones including galagin, pinocembrin and pinostrobin. These ﬂavonoids are reported to increase the bacterial membrane permeability and inhibit bacterial genetic coding. Further, ﬂavonoids have been reported to inhibit nucleic acid synthesis, attachment and formation of biofilms and energy metabolism of bacteria and as such demonstrate efective anti-bacterial agents. Similarly to antibacterial activity, there is a range of reported mechanisms for propolis antiviral activity, however research has been limited to investigating CAPE and other related compounds. CAPE blocks the NF-kB activation process, and is an inhibitor of HIV-1 integrase produced by retroviruses, therefore it inhibits the integration of genetic material into the host’s DNA cell. In addition, CAPE also supresses in vitro replication of hepatitis C virus, thus demonstrating both antibacterial and viral effects.

In a recent study Alkhaldy et al. reported propolis derived phenolics appear to protect the gastrointestinal tract by inhibiting the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Clostridium spp, Staphylococcus aureus and bacteriosides spp. In addition, Alkhaldy et al. reported propolis suppressed the adhesion of pathogens to the intestinal wall and enhanced systemic immune function including natural killer cell activity and cytokine secretion.

Propolis has been reported to stimulate the growth of skin tissue and regeneration as well as modulate collagen production. Burn wounds treated with propolis were found to have lower concentrations of free radicals. Propolis has been reported to reduce oxidative stress in wounds by inducing the expression of antioxidant related genes (hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1), glutamate-cysteine ligase- modifier GCLM and- catalytic GCLC subunits), and improve collagen expression and cell viability on cells exposed to significant oxidative stress. In vitro investigation demonstrated the addition of propolis could alleviate cell damage in fibroblast cells by suppressing intracellular free radical production induced by excessive light. While direct antioxidant benefits have been discussed, the anti-inﬂammatory effects of propolis have also been shown to improve wound healing.
