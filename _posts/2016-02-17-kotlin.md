Is a pragmatic programming language for JVM and Android that combines OO and functional features and is focused on interoperability, safety, clarity and tooling support.

Being a general-purpose language, Kotlin works everywhere where Java works: server-side applications, mobile applications (Android), desktop applications. It works with all major tools and services such as

-IntelliJ IDEA, Android Studio and Eclipse
-Maven, Gradle and Ant
-Spring Boot (Kotlin support released today!)
-GitHub, Slack and even Minecraft
