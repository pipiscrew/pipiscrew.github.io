Is dedicated to capture screen of Android phone without rooting a handset. However, you will need to have a phone connected to a desktop/laptop via USB port. In such a way it can be used for full screen presentations, automatic screen capture, and screenshot transformations such as scaling and rotating. You have to install only an application to computer. Java + ADB drivers required.
