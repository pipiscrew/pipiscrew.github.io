Wp-vcd is hiding itself in pirated Wordpress themes. The pirated themes can be found on several websites via the
Google search. When installed, Wp-vcd will compromise the systems of webmasters who are not
willing to pay for the work of a developer.

Initially the backdoor was found by downloading the theme ExProduct from the site downloadfreethemes. This website is hosting a lot of pirated Wordpress themes. At the time of writing, the site was hosting 32.200 themes.
