Browser extension has been released, with as its first main feature: local web page preservation. If I find an important page on the web, storing it is never easy, and I remain dependent on others to provide it when I need it. If the original source stops serving it, it may simply be lost â€” almost as if a book would disappear when its author retires.

This extension attempts to turn the browser into an offline-first knowledge management tool. It can store web pages you visit on your computer by 'freeze-drying' them: removing scripts and thus most interactive behaviour, but inlining all images and stylesheets to let you save the page exactly the way you saw it.
