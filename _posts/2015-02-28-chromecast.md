<span style="color: #ff0000;">**SecondScreen**</span>

Is an application designed for power users that frequently connect their Android devices to external displays. It provides tools to give you the best big screen experience possible â€“ for example, you can change your device's resolution and density to fit your TV or monitor, enable always-on desktop mode in Chrome, and even turn your device's backlight off. With SecondScreen, you can turn your existing Android device into a set top box, a game console, or even a PC replacement!

<span style="color: #ff0000;">**Web Video Caster (Chromecast)**</span>

Allows you to stream videos you find on the web to any Chromecast device. The app does all the **dirty work** of finding the embedded videos inside web pages, making it super simple for you to just hit play and enjoy!
