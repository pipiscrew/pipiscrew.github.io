If you want to take part in helping scientists find a coronavirus cure, you can now donate some of your unused Mac processing power to work on cracking COVID-19. Thanks to a collaboration between the Folding@home Consortium and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, you can donate your unused computational resources so researchers can use them to better understand the coronavirus. All you need to do is download this free client, which connects your PC to a distributed network of computers.

That’s not the only technological initiative the coronavirus has inspired.

Researchers from [Alibaba ](https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/03/02/alibabas-new-ai-system-can-detect-coronavirus-in-seconds-with-96-accuracy/)developed an artificial intelligence system that diagnoses the virus in a matter of seconds, with 96% accuracy.

The Chinese government too developed an app to detect COVID-19 infections, but recent reports suggest the app is [sharing users’ data with police](https://thenextweb.com/china/2020/03/03/chinas-covid-19-app-reportedly-color-codes-people-and-shares-data-with-cops/).
