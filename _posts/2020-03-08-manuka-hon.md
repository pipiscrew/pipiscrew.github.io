The Manuka tree, a relative to the Tea Tree, grows abundantly throughout New Zealand, often in extremely rugged and remote terrain. When hives are placed in areas where these Manuka trees dominate the landscape, bees feed off the nectar. The result? Manuka Honey.

As modern medicine grapples with the **[global epidemic](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/)** of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, studies are revealing Mother Nature may have had the answer all along.

In recent years, dozens of studies are unveiling the powerful antibiotic, antiviral and immune-boosting properties of [raw, unprocessed Manuka honey](https://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B014AP5JUG/).

Native to New Zealand and Australia — thanks to the Manuka bushes and Tea Trees there — Manuka honey kills more strains of bacteria and “super” bacteria than any antibiotic known to mankind.

A **[2014 survey](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3970805/)** of these studies suggests Manuka honey may be the most powerful tool we have for healing chronic wounds — wounds that do not heal within four to eight weeks due to antibiotic-resistant pathogens like **[MRSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methicillin-resistant_Staphylococcus_aureus)**.

One of the [**studies**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19513768) published in the *European Journal of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases* found that Manuka honey eradicated eight strains of common “problematic” wound pathogens — those with innate or acquired antibiotic resistance.

Additionally, the harmful bacteria were not able to **['shape-shift'](http://www.superbugs.news/2017-09-16-shapeshifting-bacteria-scientists-discover-how-e-coli-in-space-becomes-antibiotic-resistant.html)** or mutate and become resistant to the honey under conditions that normally trigger them to do so with conventional antibiotics.

Compounds like **methylglyoxal** in Manuka honey apparently cause multi-system failure in the bacteria, killing them before they are able to adapt and build up immunity, explains one of the authors of the study, University of Sydney microbiologist Dee Carter.

With an “urgent need for effective agents in topical wound care,” Manuka honey shows promising results, the authors of the report concluded.
