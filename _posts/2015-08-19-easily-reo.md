Determine which paragraphs you want to reorder. Then, type the number “1” as the first character (then type a space) of the paragraph you want to be first in the revised order. Type the appropriate numbers as the first characters (with a space after each number) of all the paragraphs you want to reorder, similar to making a numbered list.

From there, just select all the text, then navigate to Paragraph > Sort Text > Sort by and select “number.” Your paragraphs are automatically rearranged in the order you assigned.
