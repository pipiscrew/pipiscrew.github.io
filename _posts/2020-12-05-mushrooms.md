This **blend of carbohydrates** makes mushrooms an excellent **prebiotic**.

In addition to their vitamins, minerals and probiotics, there are other benefits that classify them as a medicinal superfood. Mushrooms (white / brown) are considered:

➜ Anti-inflammatory
➜ Antioxidant
➜ Anti-cancer

This means they can help **neutralize** 
➜ free radicals
➜ combat cancer
➜ reduce chronic inflammation

[source](https://www.livestrong.com/article/530501-nutritional-content-of-white-vs-crimini-mushrooms/)

The most common type is **Agaricus bisporus**.

The difference between varieties of mushrooms is just age. The **white** mushrooms is the youngest variety. The **portobello** is the most mature mushroom, it’s really just an overgrown white mushroom! The **brown** (cremini) mushroom, is just in between these two varieties. It’s a moderately mature version of the white mushroom and it’s younger than the portobello. [source](https://www.thekitchn.com/what-are-cremini-mushrooms-a-f-73949)

### Antioxidants of Edible Mushrooms (2015)

A specific compound called **ergothioneine** that **protects** all of your **cells** from **oxidative stress and damage**, which interferes with the **body's** ability to properly **detoxify** and contributes to chronic disease, like heart disease and cancer.

Since earliest times **mushrooms** have been treated as a **special kind of food**. The **Greeks** believed that mushrooms provided strength for warriors in battle. The **Pharaohs** prized mushrooms as a delicacy, and the **Romans** regarded mushrooms as a “<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Food of the Gods</span>” and served them only on festive occasions. The **Chinese** treasured mushrooms as a health food, the “<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">elixir of life</span>”. The **Mexican Indians** used mushrooms as hallucinogens in religious ceremonies and in witchcraft, as well as for therapeutic purposes. There is little doubt that early humans tried and tested mushrooms, and by trial and error became familiar with types worth collecting and those to avoid.

Proteins are made up from over 20 amino acids in varying amounts, they are quantitatively different. The human body can convert some of these amino acids into others, but there are **nine essential amino acids** :

➜ lysine
➜ methionine
➜ tryptophane
➜ threonine
➜ valine
➜ leucine
➜ isoleucine
➜ histidine
➜ phenylalanine

Furthermore, these **nine essential amino acids** must be **present simultaneously** and in correct relative amounts for **protein synthesis** to occur. If **one** or more should be in **inadequate supply**, the utilization of **all others** in the cellular pool **will be reduced** in the same proportion.

There is no doubt that mushroom-based products can serve as superior dietary supplements, particularly, the [Ganoderma products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganoderma), which have been used as a dietary supplement or medicinal food in China for more than 2000 years. Recently, the products of medicinal mushrooms have been demonstrated to enhance the immune system and promote the natural defense system. They are also good for patients who have received treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy, as they may help to reduce the side effects from such therapies. These include :

➜ increasing the number of leukocytes in the blood, and enhancing the immune functions
➜ increasing and improving appetite
➜ reducing pain
➜ anti-emetic properties
➜ stopping hair loss
➜ inducing tumor regression
➜ potential antioxidant and genoprotective properties
➜ general health-improving effects

Exactly how these products work is still a matter of conjecture, but numerous trials (both laboratory and human) have shown, again and again, that they are effective in complementing conventional medicines in ﬁghting diseases.
