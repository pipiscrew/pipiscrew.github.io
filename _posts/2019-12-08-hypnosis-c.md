Hypnosis isn’t necessarily a “cure”; it’s a tool. What I learned was that people who are struggling with phobias, trauma and other mental health problems can see results with hypnosis if they’re open to it.

As she recited a slew of jumbled words, it felt as if a magic wand was sprinkling tranquillity around me like glitter. A tingling overcame my body as the chimes circled my brain like waves. And with that, a small part of my unease was sucked out of my body. By the end, she counted to five and my eyes struggled to open from what felt like a deep meditation.
