This is a collection of directives that implement the Office UI Fabric components with no script dependencies except for Angular. The aim is to make it easier to use the components in fabric within Angular applications.
You don't have to know all the CSS classes that Fabric uses or exactly how the HTML should line up, the directives do that for you. In addition, because it's more than just CSS, we will have useful functionality in our directives. For instance, ultimately the table will provide sortable columns!
