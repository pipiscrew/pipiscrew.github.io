The Federal Communications Commission is set to propose about $200 million in fines against four major cellphone carriers for selling customers’ real-time location data, according to three people briefed on the discussions.

The trade in location data has emerged as a sensitive privacy issue because it affects hundreds of millions of people and can reveal intimate details about their lives, including personal relationships and visits to doctors. “It puts the safety and privacy of every American with a wireless phone at risk,” Jessica Rosenworcel, a Democratic commissioner at the F.C.C., said in a statement last month about the agency’s investigation.
