In 2013 something unexpected happened. A new technique known as the "FairPlay Man-In-The-Middle" (MITM) attack exploited flaws in Apple’s ‘Fairplay’ DRM system to allow both pirated and third-party software (unapproved by Apple) to run on iOS devices. **Crucially, this could all take place without a jailbreak being deployed on the device.**

In the "FairPlay MITM" attack, attackers purchase an app from App Store then intercept and save the authorization code. They then developed PC software that simulates the iTunes client behaviors, and tricks iOS devices to believe the app was purchased by victim. Therefore, the user can install apps they never actually paid for, and the creator of the software can install potentially malicious apps without the user’s knowledge.
