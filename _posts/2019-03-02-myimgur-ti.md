Is the most handy capture and uploader tool youâ€™ll ever find for Windows computers. Intuitive 1-click actions and simple settings to very quickly capture areas of your screen or specific windows and send them to Imgur for sharing, or select a few files from your computer and drag them to Imgur to have them sent in a batch without any further actions.
