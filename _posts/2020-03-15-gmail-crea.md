Paul Buchheit he was the 23rd employee at Google, where he built Gmail and the first prototype for Adsense. After leaving Google he co-founded Friendfeed, which was acquired by Facebook.

Larry and Wayne Rosing at 2001 said to Paul :

> we want you to build an email something

when thinking to leave google

> Oh wow, here I am in a meeting with a bunch of people I don't know who are telling me to do stuff that I don't care about

Paul said :

for Bret Taylor

> I've never encountered anyone else who combines being an incredible engineer, and being an incredible product person, and an incredible manager, and an incredible designer. He is good at everythingâ€”it's unfair!

for Craig Silverstein

> was another, he was the very first Google employee. He is someone who types and programs faster than I can perceive what he's doing. Sometimes I like to watch other engineers work so I can learn how they do things. But with Craig he moved too fast for that. The screen would flicker and code would just appear. He'd constantly be flipping buffers in Emacs or whatever. He types so fast. I've never seen anyone else that fast
