> Symptom : I am using Full text search with SQL server 2005. Everything works fine except searching with one digit Keywords. For example search with '1' or '2' does not work but search with '12' works fine.

SQL Server 2005
The file is: ~/FTData/noiseeng.txt (noiseeng.txt is for great Britain . For US its noiseENU.txt). Removing these from the noise list will fix the problem. 

SQl Server 2008
You should note that noisewords were replaced by stopwords.

## Full-Text Index not Indexing numbers

Writes : 
I have no trouble searching numbers with fulltext indexing.  

If you are having trouble with single-digits, such as 0, 1, 2, etc., then you need to edit your noise word list (2005) or stopwords (2008) to remove those words.   

It so happens that I have two noise word lists (I am running 2005 still) in a single database.  <b style="color:red">English has the single-digits as noise words**, and I edited the British English noise word list to have no noise words at all.  (I use English and British English as my languages for full-text indexes, so that I can control where I have noise words and where I do not.)

2008: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142551.aspx](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms142551.aspx)

In both platforms you can change the noise/stop words.  Once you do this, you will need to repopulate the affected indexes so that they will include the formerly excluded words in the index.

### ~~Tested & Working~~

If the SYSTEM stop word (or noise word) list is being used it contains each of the numeric digits as words to be ignored. You can change the contents of the Stop Word list or you can turn off the Stop Words altogether.

```js
--source : http://stackoverflow.com/a/12483307
ALTER FULLTEXT INDEX ON dbo.my_ft_table SET STOPLIST = OFF;```

Once one of these changes is made, the text affected must be reindexed before the single digits become searchable. After the reindexing it will indeed be possible to search for '6'.
