Google announced plans on Friday to shut down the company's URL shortening service Goo.gl starting April 13, 2018.

Google won't change or disable existing links; all existing links will continue to redirect to the link target.

Spammers started to use the services to obfuscate the target URL and pass spam detection tools and services.
