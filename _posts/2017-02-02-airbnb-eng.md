Adding animation to native apps a snap. Is an iOS, Android, and React Native library that renders **After Effects animations** in real time, and allows native apps to use animations as easily as they use static assets. Lottie uses animation data exported as JSON files from an open-source After Effects extension called Bodymovin.
