Enhances Windows by adding several advanced functions to the standard **Open File** and**Save File** dialog boxes.

FileBox adds two handy buttons to these standard dialogs. These appear on the *right side* of the Windows dialog box title bars. These buttons appear next to the minimize, restore, and maximize buttons with which you're probably already familiar.
