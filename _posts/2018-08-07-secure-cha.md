#### 2017-06-27 - PHP Secure Chat: Chat box between users using encrypted messages

https://www.phpclasses.org/package/10121-PHP-Chat-box-between-users-using-encrypted-messages.html
This package implements chat box between users using encrypted messages.

It can output HTML and JavaScript to implement a chat box between users.

They use a commonly agreed password to encrypt the messages using BlowFish before they are sent to the server via AJAX.

The server stores the encrypted messages in a MySQL database before they are delivered and decrypted to other chat users with the same password.

[deprecated] [https://github.com/TheFox/phpchat](https://github.com/TheFox/phpchat)

Because we need to encrypt and secure the Internet. The Internet is broken and we need to fix it. Thanks people like [Edward Snowden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Snowden) we know today that the [NSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Agency) (and also other [intelligence agencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_agency) too) operates a [global surveillance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) on citizens. We can't loose our right of freedom, our right of privacy to centralized governmental authorities. Now it's our move. It's time to fight back!
