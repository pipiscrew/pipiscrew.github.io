It's an article about an early Mac game called _Through the Looking Glass_, and to quote the relevant section:

"Steve Capps, the Apple programmer who developed _Through the Looking Glass_ [...] also designed and drew the game's two fonts, Alice-12 and Cartoon-12."

A font from an early 1st-party Mac game made it (questionably?) onto some Mac shareware disks.

A programmer at EA found it, converted it, and included it with Deluxe Paint.

From there, it then appeared in a lot of other games whose artists used that program.
