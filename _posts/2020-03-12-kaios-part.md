KaiOS Technologies and Mozilla have announced a partnership that will see the Gecko browser engine improved on KaiOS. According to the announcement, developers from the firms will ensure that future versions of Gecko are compatible on KaiOS devices enabling a “more diverse and open mobile internet.”

KaiOS is a [fork](https://github.com/kaiostech/gecko-b2g) of Boot to Gecko OS (B2G OS) which itself was a fork of the now-defunct Firefox OS which was built using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By establishing the partnership, KaiOS devices will stay secure and performant, an immediate benefit will be support for TLS 1.3. As Gecko evolves, these devices will gain new capabilities such as better PWA (Progressive Web App) and WebAssembly support.

Sebastien Codeville, CEO of KaiOS Technologies, said:

> We’re excited to be working closely with Mozilla. Mozilla’s work on Boot 2 Gecko served as the backbone of KaiOS from the beginning. Through this partnership we can enable new features, improve security, and ensure better overall performance of KaiOS. Broadly speaking, these updates will mean many first-time internet users gain access to more of the web’s advanced digital services on devices that are affordable, reliable, and secure

The firm revealed that its KaiStore currently has more than 400 apps designed for low-memory hardware; some of these apps include Google Assistant, WhatsApp, YouTube, Facebook, and Google Maps.
