Is a PHP script which reads a given source directory (or multiple directories) with its subdirectories and creates set of directories filled with the content of the source directory, arranged in groups to fit a given capacity. It can be used to create CD/DVD sets for backups. It also supports ISO image creation, direct CD/DVD burning via cdrecord, automatic file index creation and more.
