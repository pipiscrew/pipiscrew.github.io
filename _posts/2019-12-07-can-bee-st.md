**Gschwind** asked. “One, two, three.” She <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">held the bee’s butt about an inch</span> to the left of **Avery’s** lower spine and waited for the tiny stinger to pierce the skin. Then she pulled away the bee, now <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">missing its stinger</span>, which was still drilling into **Avery’s** back.

This process would continue until the bottom portion of **Avery’s** spine looked like a clear highway running between two parallel rows of five inflamed bumps. Each protrusion was dotted with a stinger, moving like a pumpjack atop a tiny, rising hill, as it continued to gently, rhythmically, excrete venom. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Twenty minutes later, when the barbs had done their job and stopped moving</span>, **Gschwind** extracted them.
