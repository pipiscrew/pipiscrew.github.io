The app is still in beta (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.torproject.torbrowser_alpha). Comes with VPN of course, you’ll have to download a separate Orbot proxy app (https://guardianproject.info/apps/orbot/). The developers hope the final version won’t require the separate app anymore.
