If food enzymes do some of the work, the enzyme potential can <strong>allot less activity</strong> to <strong>digestive enzymes</strong>, <strong>and have much more</strong> to <strong>give</strong> the thousands of <strong>metabolic enzymes</strong> that <strong>run the entire body</strong>. If the human organism must devote a huge portion of its enzyme potential to making digestive enzymes, it spells trouble for the whole body because <strong>it drains the pool</strong> of <strong>enzyme machinery</strong> needed to make the <strong>metabolic enzymes</strong>. This has <strong>systemic repercussions</strong>. The <strong>difference</strong> between a <strong>healthy</strong> and <strong>unhealthy</strong> <strong>food</strong> is largely <strong>related</strong> to its <strong>enzyme content</strong>. No food in its natural state, full of enzymes, is bad. Whether this be milk, butter, meat etc… <strong>Metabolic enzymes</strong> run every aspect of <strong>human biology</strong> from moving the muscles to thinking thoughts.</p><h3 id="digestive-enzymes">Digestive enzymes</h3><p>Have only three main jobs: Digesting protein, carbohydrate and fat. <strong>Proteases</strong> are <strong>enzymes</strong> that :</p><p>➜ digest protein. ➜ amylase digest carbohydrate. ➜ lipases digest fat.</p><p><strong>Enzymes</strong> emerge as the true <strong>yardstick</strong> of <strong>vitality</strong>. Enzymes offer an important means of calculating the vital energy of an organism. That which has been referred to as vitality, vital force, vital energy, vital activity, nerve energy, nerve force, strength, vital resistance, life energy, life and life force.</p><p>The body is dependent on enzymes. Enzymes are catalysts that <strong>lower the energy</strong> required to drive a <strong>reaction</strong>. Enzymes <strong>are temperature dependent</strong>. <strong>While enzymes do more work with increasing temperatures, they are used up faster.</strong> This is why the <strong>body temperature is increased</strong> in the <strong>case</strong> of <strong>fever</strong> (aka the enzymes of the white blood cells are more active).</p><p>The <strong>extra work enzymes</strong> do <strong>during a fever</strong>, however, causes some of them to <strong>wear out</strong> to an extent that the system excretes them in the <strong>urine</strong>. In other words, <strong>accelerating enzyme activity or depleting enzymes</strong> always comes at a <strong>cost to the biological organism</strong>. These costs, however, can be offset <strong>if the organism has an ample reserve of enzymes or if enzymes are repleted</strong>. Since antiquity, enzymes from raw foods have been the <strong>source of deposits to our vitality account</strong> that has <strong>allowed us to live healthy, free from chronic disease</strong>.</p><p><strong>Duration of life varies inversely with the intensity of metabolism</strong>.</p><p>In fact, we have recently seen scientific papers showing that by consuming less calories, rats and fruit flies (Daphnia sp.) are able to <strong>expand their lifespan and limit damage to their DNA</strong>. The mechanism of this phenomena is <strong>unknown</strong>, however, we propose it is the rationing of enzymes that is partly responsible for the pancreas “must steal, beg, and borrow these entities stored in the whole body to make the enzyme complex necessary to digest food devoid of intrinsic enzymes that aid in the digestion of food and liberation of nutrients and vital energy”.</p><p>We believe there is evidence suggesting, <strong>that when the enzyme potential is exhausted beyond a particular point, it <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">triggers</span> the <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">end of the lifespan</span></strong>.</p><p>If you <strong>take in reinforcements of enzymes</strong> in your <strong>early years</strong>, your later years will be <strong>healthier and happier</strong>.</p><p>By <strong>eating food</strong> with their enzymes intact and by supplementing cooked foods with <strong>enzyme capsules</strong>, we can <strong>stop</strong> abnormal and <strong>pathological aging processes</strong>.</p><p>We suggest that <strong>if we postpone</strong> the <strong>debilitation</strong> of metabolic enzyme activity, what we now call old age could become the <strong>glorious prime of life</strong>. Enzymes, thus, may be the <strong>fountain of life</strong> so earnestly sought for and so mysteriously allusive. It is the destruction of enzymes by heat and the lack of raw foods in the diet that contributes to this factor. For example, <strong>human milk</strong> has a good amount of lipase which assists the baby in digesting the high fat content of milk, which it certainly needs. <strong>Bovine milk</strong> also contains scores of enzymes (35+ different known enzymes), most of which are <strong>destroyed by pasteurization</strong> (due high temperatures), that are health promoting. It is interesting to note that the <strong>negative</strong> health effects of drinking milk <strong>only began</strong> to surface after the <strong>pasteurization</strong> of milk and cultures that drink milk raw <strong>do not seem to suffer</strong> heart disease, atherosclerosis and other disadvantages now associated to our <strong>enzymeless milk</strong>.</p><p>Less than 50 years ago <strong>before mass pasteurization</strong> of milk, the <strong>raw milk</strong> diet was in vague and was reported to have <strong>success in treating</strong> a variety of <strong>ailments</strong>.</p><p><strong>Grains</strong> are <strong>naturally endowed</strong> with <strong>amylase</strong> and some <strong>protease</strong> and <strong>lipase</strong>. <strong>Raw honey</strong> has considerable amounts of <strong>amylase</strong> (the amylase being derived from the pollen of flowers, rather than from the bee). In other cultures, the use of <strong>fermented foods</strong>, aged cheese, aged meat, sprouted grains and raw fruits and vegetables <strong>provide an enzyme rich</strong> diet. Fermented foods (examples such as miso, Kabitofu, Toyu, Natto, Tempeh, masato, malakachisa, tofu, certain soybean products such as Soy Sauce) are <strong>loaded with enzymes</strong>. The presence of these foods in these cultural diets have been associated with <strong>tremendous health benefits</strong> and <strong>disease protection</strong>. We must think of food enzymes as part of our food and necessary.</p><p>Food enzymes have always existing in all foods and for that reason are believed to <strong>fulfill a biological need</strong>. Therefore, <strong>enzymes are a fourth class</strong> of essential nutrients, along with macronutrients (fats, proteins, carbohydrates), vitamins and minerals.</p><p>Enzymes must be handled with care as they are fragile and vulnerable to excessive heat and/or light. “A cooking stove, which is a human invention, does not come permanently attached as a part of the anatomy of a newly born infant!” It is becoming evident that those <strong>diseases</strong> which are <strong>human trademarks</strong>, such as <strong>cancer **and **heart disease</strong>, are the products of <strong>perverted metabolism</strong> induced partly by the <strong>hidden machinations of food enzyme deficiency</strong>.<em>**</em></p><p><strong>Sugar is an enzyme and nutrient thief</strong>. Being almost 100 percent pure, this <strong>high-calorie dynamite <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">bombs</span></strong> the <strong>pancreas</strong> and <strong>pituitary gland</strong> into <strong>gushing</strong> forth a hyper-secretion of hormones comparable in intensity to that artificially produced by drugs and hormones. The <strong>glands</strong> know the organism has been <strong>loaded up with calories</strong>, but in despite of searching, the nutrients that normally go along with the calories <strong>cannot be found in the body</strong>. <strong>Evidence suggests sugar</strong> can cause <strong>liver enlargement and lesions in the pancreas and pituitary which can disrupt enzyme machinery and hormone regulation</strong>. In 1971 an editorial in Food and Cosmetics Toxicology cited many references implicating <strong>sugar as a causative factor in</strong> :</p><p>➜ atherosclerosis ➜ coronary disease ➜ kidney disease ➜ liver disease ➜ platelet adhesiveness ➜ increased blood lipids ➜ shortened lifespan.</p><p>As in other countries, the rise in sugar consumption parallels the increase in coronary heart disease. Studies in 1972 at the University of Hawaii showed that ¾ of <strong>pigs fed a high-sugar diet developed heart disease</strong>.</p><p>Calorie indexes, and science, make not distinction between the amount of raw and cooked calories. As a general rule, <strong>cooked foods are much more fattening than raw foods</strong>, even of the same type (i.e. raw vs. cooked bananas). <strong>Fat is not fattening, especially when present in it’s raw state</strong>. Fatty foods, in their raw state, are <strong>naturally endowed</strong> with copious amounts of <strong>lipase</strong>, an <strong>enzyme</strong> which helps <strong>break down and metabolize the fat</strong>.</p><p><strong>Enzymes</strong> are the <strong>workers</strong> and <strong>hormones</strong> are the <strong>**foreman</strong>. Hormones** can have <strong>no effect</strong> <strong>without the work being done by the enzymes</strong> they direct. <strong>Therefore, **enzyme deficiency affects the endocrine system</strong> in three ways:**</p><p>➜ by overstimulating the glands by improper assimilation of nutrients. ➜ is undernourishing the gland by the same mechanism. ➜ is attenuating the hormone response by depleting enzyme reserves and activity.</p><p><strong>Allergies</strong> are a <strong>primary indication</strong> for enzyme therapy. Food allergy results when the <strong>protease</strong>, <strong>amylase</strong>, and <strong>lipase</strong> in the blood <strong>fall below a certain level</strong> (according to Dr. A.W. Oelgoetz n a report published in the 1936 Medical Record), <strong>allowing unhydrolyzed food</strong> substances to <strong>accumulate</strong> in the <strong>blood</strong> (allergy appears to be due, in part at least, to absorption of incompletely digested protein molecules). Also, when scavenger enzymes are not able to handle the load of waste removal, <strong>nature may throw</strong> some of the <strong>unwanted material</strong> out through the <strong>skin, nose, throat</strong> or other orifices.</p><p>Dr. Oelgoetz recorded positive responses to using enzymes in conditions such as Chronic angioneurotic edema, allergic eczema, pancreatic indigestion, allergic headache, allergic vomiting, chronic urticaria (hives), allergic edema, allergic colitis and pancreatic achylia. Other conditions noted to respond to enzyme therapy is psoriasis, bronchial asthma, food asthma, food eczema, hay fever, and loose bowels.</p><h3 id="enzyme-supplementation">Enzyme supplementation</h3><p><strong>Vegetarian enzymes</strong> are made by a fermentation method using cultured fungi, such as Aspergilli. Are especially valuable for aid in <strong>pre-digestion</strong> in the Food Enzyme Stomach because they <strong>digest best</strong> in a mild acidic environment, whereas, <strong>animal derived enzymes</strong> work best in a basic environment and therefore <strong>are not active</strong> until they <strong>reach</strong> the <strong>duodenum</strong>.</p><p>Shortened lifespan, inferior health of the organs, and nagging illnesses; and <strong>all due to an enzyme-deficient diet</strong>. The <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #ff0000;">political </span>and <span style="background-color: #ffff00; color: #ff0000;">financial </span>powers that benefit from the use of highly denatured, refined, <strong>enzymeless</strong>, life-less food would have us to believe that cooking, refining, bleaching, radiation, etc. . . are safe.

Biotechnology can <strong>contribute</strong> to the problems of our human culture and civilization from <strong>health, food, energy, environment, and to materials</strong> issues. Biotechnology is therefore playing a key role in <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">pharmaceutical, medical, chemical, electronics, energy, and environment industries</span>.</p><p>For the <strong>development</strong> of <strong>biotechnology</strong>, deep understanding and fusions in biology, chemistry, <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">enzymology</span> and engineering are required. One fundamental area of biotechnology is <strong>enzyme engineering</strong> which covers <strong>enzymology</strong>, <strong>enzyme technology</strong>, and <strong>engineering</strong> of <strong>enzymes</strong>. Enzymes have been used for food preparations such as cheese and alcohols from long time ago. In <strong>1970s</strong>, immobilized enzymes have accelerated the development of enzyme engineering. In <strong>1980s</strong>, the understanding of <strong>enzyme reaction in organic solvent</strong> has created a <strong>new area</strong> in <strong>enzyme engineering</strong>. Also with the energy and environment crisis, bio-based chemicals and <strong>bioenergy</strong> have <strong>opened</strong> a <strong>new area</strong> in <strong>enzyme engineering</strong>.</p><p>The <strong>microorganisms</strong> were widely used among ancient people. The manufacture of cheeses, breads, alcoholic beverages, and many other applications depends upon microorganisms which were found from ancient text of Babylon, Greece, Egypt, China, and India. <strong>Enzymes</strong> were the <strong>main components</strong> in microorganisms for the <strong>food manufacturing</strong> and other applications.</p><p>From the early of <strong>nineteenth centuries</strong>, enzymes have been investigated by scientists in a more <strong>systematic way</strong>. The technology development for the <strong>separation of enzymes from microorganisms</strong> is one of the important technological advancements. The disruption of microorganisms by mechanical means (e.g., high-pressure homogenizer) allowed the <strong>isolation</strong> of <strong>intracellular enzyme</strong>.</p><p>Enzymes can function both inside cells (<strong>intracellular</strong>) or outside cells (<strong>extracellular</strong>).</p><h3 id="extracellular-enzyme-activity">Extracellular enzyme activity</h3><p>For example, the enzymes that function in our digestive systems are manufactured in cells - but work extracellularly. Spiders and flies are two examples of animals that have taken extracellular digestion a step further. They secrete an enzyme soup into or on their food. In spiders, this is injected into the prey’s body. The enzyme soup digests the prey’s body contents (specific enzymes breaking down proteins to amino acids, lipids into fatty acids and glycerol and polysaccharides into monosaccharides) and the spider simply sucks up the resulting already digested food.</p><h3 id="intracellular-enzyme-activity">Intracellular enzyme activity</h3><p>Enzymes that act inside cells are responsible for catalysing the millions of reactions that occur in metabolic pathways such as glycolysis in the mitochondria and in the photosynthetic pathway in the chloroplast. The lysosome contains many enzymes that are mainly responsible for destroying old cells. (<a href="http://resources.hwb.wales.gov.uk/VTC/Phase1/wales/aslevel/biology/molecules/enzymes/Enzymefunctioning/Intracellularandextracellularenzymes/default.htm">src</a>)</p><p>However, isolation of these intracellular enzymes was quite expensive.</p><p>The next technological advancement is <strong>recombinant DNA technology</strong>. This technology <strong>together with protein engineering</strong> allows <strong>new</strong> and <strong>better enzyme variants</strong> to be quickly <strong>produced</strong>. Since around 1990, directed evolution has been used as a powerful tool for enzyme engineering. This method contributed a lot in the development of enzymatic processes for industrial applications to <strong>harness</strong> the capability of <strong>naturally occurring enzyme</strong> since in most cases, natural <strong>enzymes are not optimized</strong> for <strong>industrial reaction conditions</strong>.</p><p>Current issues and recent advances in enzyme engineering is the computational design. The <strong>computational design of enzyme</strong> is <strong>another method</strong> that has been <strong>developed</strong> around year <strong>2000</strong>. This is accomplished using computer models to suggest sequences and structures that can work for the desired properties of the enzyme. Understanding the mechanism of enzymes in detail and the structure of functional enzyme can make enzyme technology jump one more step. At present, the <strong>study of enzymes</strong> is still one of the <strong>important</strong> issues to the <strong>scientific community</strong> and to the industry sector in general. <strong>Artificial enzymes, catalytic antibody</strong> are examples of current issues in enzyme engineering. Recently, synthesis of ammonia through enzymes was reported (<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6284/448">Brown 2016</a>), which can be a <strong>breakthrough</strong> of <strong>enzyme engineering in chemistry and chemical industry</strong>. Enzymes are continuously utilized for many <strong>industrial applications</strong> including their recent usages in <strong>chemicals production</strong> as well as their traditional roles. <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Many challenging issues are still waiting</span>.</p><p><strong>Modern enzyme technology</strong> was started when it was shown that <strong>sugars</strong> can be <strong>obtained from starch</strong> using an alcohol precipitate of malt extract. The compound in the precipitate which can yield dextrins from starch was later called diastase. By the mid-nineteenth century, <strong>more enzymes</strong> were <strong>discovered</strong> including pepsin, invertase, and peroxidase. After <strong>enzyme technology</strong> became <strong>established</strong>, enzymes as catalyst for <strong>industrial use</strong> were widely investigated.</p><p>Taka-Diastase (<a href="https://www.jpo.go.jp/seido_e/rekishi_e/jokichi_takmine.htm">Dr. Takamine succeeded in crystallizing and isolating adrenaline</a>) was patented for industrial application: amylolytic enzyme produced by Aspergillus oryzae (fungus that has been used for thousands of years to make soy sauce). Now enzymes are <strong>being utilized</strong> for various applications from <strong>pharmaceuticals</strong> to diagnostics.</p><p>Approximately <strong>5000 enzymes</strong> have been characterized so far, while more than <strong>300 enzymes</strong> are <strong>commercially</strong> available and supplied from <strong>enzyme manufactures</strong>. Depending on the reactions they catalyze, enzymes are grouped according to the report of the <a href="http://blankrefer.com/?http://www.sbcs.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/">Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry (1984)</a></p><p>Enzymes are named by adding the suffix—<strong>ase</strong> to the name of their substrate. However, there are also enzymes that have been given names that do not denote their substrates such as pepsin and trypsin. To avoid ambiguities, International Union of Biochemistry (IUB) assigned each enzyme a name and a <strong>four-level number</strong>. The Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers (<a href="http://blankrefer.com/?https://enzyme.expasy.org/">ref - repository</a>) <strong>divide</strong> enzymes into <strong>six main groups</strong> <strong>depending</strong> on the <strong>reactions</strong> they <strong>catalyze</strong>. For this EC number system, the first, second, third, and fourth number refers to the class of enzyme, subclass by the type of substrate or the bond cleaved, subclass by the electron acceptor of the type of group removed and serial number of enzyme found, respectively.</p><p>The <strong>quantification</strong> of enzymes is often <strong>difficult</strong> to determine in absolute terms such as grams, since the activity changes due to conformations and the environments such as temperature and pH. More relevant parameter is <strong>to express</strong> the e<strong>nzyme activity</strong> in terms of the activity unit (U).</p><p>Enzymes have numerous applications in <strong>food, medical, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries</strong>. The industries have grown rapidly over the past decades and are expected to continue their growth. Table shows the applications of <strong>biocatalysts</strong> and its <strong>production</strong> scale. For this enzymatic processes, various enzymes have been applied.</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><tbody><tr><td>Production scale<td>Product<td>Enzyme<td style="width: 75px;">Company<tr><td>&gt;1,000,000<td>High-fructose corn syrup (HFSC)<td>Glucose isomerase<td style="width: 75px;">Various<tr><td>&gt;100,000<td>Lactose-free milk<td>Lactase<td style="width: 75px;">Various<tr><td rowspan="2">&gt;10,000<td>Acrylamide<td>Nitrilase<td style="width: 75px;">Nitto Co.<tr><td>Cocoa butter<td>Lipase (CRL)<td style="width: 75px;">Fuji oil<tr><td rowspan="2">&gt;1000<td>Aspartame<td>Thermolysin<td style="width: 75px;">Tosoh/DSM<tr><td>Nicotinamide<td>Nitrilase<td style="width: 75px;">Lonza<tr><td rowspan="2">&gt;100<td>Ampicillin<td>Penicillin amidase<td style="width: 75px;">DSM-Gist Brocades<tr><td>(S)-methoxyisopropylamine<td>Lipase<td style="width: 75px;"><span style="background-color: #ffff00;">BASF</span></table></div><p>Biocatalysts in industries are generally used to <strong>produce their natural products and derivatives</strong>. <strong>Pharmaceutical</strong> sector especially dominates applications of biocatalysts (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166902003609">Straanthof 2002</a>).</p><p>Approximately more than <strong>200 microbial-origin</strong> enzymes are used <strong>commercially</strong>.

However, many researchers in academia and industry are <strong>still looking</strong> for more applications and <strong>better technologies</strong>. The <strong>relationship</strong> between <strong>structure</strong> and <strong>function</strong> has been <strong>extensively investigated</strong>, but still <strong>remains</strong> as one of the <strong>hottest</strong> current issues in <strong>enzyme engineering</strong>.

Enzymes <strong>produced</strong> from <strong>microorganisms</strong> have, in many cases, <strong>better properties</strong> such as high stablity than enzymes from plant or animal sources.</p><p><strong>Identification</strong> of <strong>microorganisms</strong> that are <strong>suitable</strong> for the enzyme production starts by <strong>screening</strong> a wide variety of Generally Recognized As Safe (aka <strong>GRAS</strong>) organisms if possible (<a href="https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Food/GuidanceRegulation/UCM217735.pdf">FDA</a>).</p><p><strong>Animal tissues</strong> and animal <strong>secretes</strong> are also a potential source of enzymes. <a href="http://www.vivo.colostate.edu/hbooks/pathphys/digestion/stomach/rennin.html">Rennin</a>, also known as chymosin, is one of the industrially important animal derived enzymes. Rennin, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspartic_protease">aspartic protease</a>, obtained from the stomach or abomasums of calves, is used for <strong>cheese production</strong> and as a <strong>digestive aid</strong>.</p><p>At present, two different approaches have been widely used independently or in combination to improve the enzymes, changing amino acid sequences of enzymes: rational design and directed evolution. <strong>Rational design</strong> uses the knowledge of enzyme’s structure-function relationship to modify the structure and improve the function. <strong>Directed evolution</strong> is similar to evolution and natural selection in the nature that random mutagenesis is introduced to an enzyme and the mutants with desirable properties are selected.</p><h2 id="fermentation-process">Fermentation Process</h2><p>Enzyme production is still an important field of biotechnology. <strong>Patents and research articles</strong> are <strong>increasing</strong> in numbers and the sales for enzymes would be close to a <strong>billion of dollars annually</strong>. Fermentation processes for microbial production of enzymes can be carried out through solid state culture or using submerged culture of microorganisms. Most enzyme manufacturers (<a href="http://blankrefer.com/?https://www.novozymes.com/en/biology">ref</a>) have produced enzymes using <strong>Submerged Fermentation</strong> (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-traditional-submerged-fermentation-SmF-method-for-producing-enzymes-process_fig1_237307348">SMF</a>) techniques. Submerged fermentation is defined as fermentation in the presence of <strong>excess water</strong>. This fermentation technique offers better monitoring and control over the process parameters, such as temperature, pH, aeration, and dispersion for efficient growth.</p><p>The total design of new <strong>biocatalytic enzymes</strong> for reactions not catalyzed by native enzymes is a <strong>big adventure</strong> in <strong>enzyme engineering</strong>. Recent advances in <strong>computational protein</strong> design have opened the <strong>new era</strong> for <strong>designing any enzymes for any target reaction</strong>. David Baker is a leader in this area. His team developed the Rosetta computational <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0019230">de novo enzyme</a> design methodology.</p><p>Nothing to do with article, encyclopedically, <strong>Penicillin</strong> is the first found antibiotic from nature and nowadays it is one of the most bulk produced antibiotics approximately <strong>30,000 tons/year</strong>.</p><p>The status of <strong>enzymes</strong> in the production of <strong>bulk chemicals</strong> seems very limited but there is significant success story despite the belief that enzymes can be only <strong>applied</strong> for the <strong>synthesis fine chemicals</strong>. The belief has background that enzymes are <strong>very expensive</strong> and limited life span due to low stability compared with conventional chemical catalysts.</p><p>src - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC250089/">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC250089/</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21741818">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21741818</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0141022987900160">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0141022987900160</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780306436529">https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9780306436529</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01143a033">https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ja01143a033</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166902003609">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0958166902003609</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283661800727">https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022283661800727</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/current-opinion-in-chemical-biology">https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/current-opinion-in-chemical-biology</a></p><p>src - <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282272769_Glucose_Isomerase_Production_of_High_Fructose_Syrups">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282272769_Glucose_Isomerase_Production_of_High_Fructose_Syrups</a></p><hr /><p>ref - <a href="http://www.emeis.gr/enzyma-to-kleidi-tis-makrozoias/">Ένζυμα – Το κλειδί της μακροζωίας</a>  (aka Enzyme Nutrition: The food enzyme concept by Dr. Edward Howell (1985) <strong>in Greek</strong>)    (<a href="http://docdroid.net/C2xRHcq">mirror</a>)    (<a href="http://blankrefer.com/?http://inspireyourlife.gr/?p=14521">mirror2</a>)</p><p>ref - <a href="https://ethernews.com/?p=2560">Ο μεγάλος ρόλος του ήπατος</a></p><p>ref - <a href="https://blog.athensweekly.gr/?p=4985">Πεπτικά ένζυμα - Ολα οσα θα επρεπε να ξερατε</a></p><p>ref - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Food+Enzymes+Health+and+Longevity">youtube videos</a></p><hr /><p>A user repied, with a story : In the past, go to the gym, meet people making resistance training (heavy weights), a guy doing this training, needed five days (aka 120hours) to recover from the exercise.
