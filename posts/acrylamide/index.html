Dr Schlundt, the World Health Organisation’s <strong>head</strong> of food safety, said after an emergency meeting in Geneva that teams of scientists in Britain, Sweden, Norway, Germany and Switzerland had confirmed the findings. They have detected acrylamide in foods such as -fried potatoes -crisps -crispbreads -breakfast cereals</p><p>Acrylamide, a human neurotoxicant and rat tumorigen, is <strong>produced in starchy foods when cooked</strong>, levels appear to be highest in foods that have been <strong>cooked at high temperatures</strong> for long periods. The substance has long been linked to many different forms of cancer, nerve damage and infertility, experts had no idea that it could produced by cooking. The 25 experts from universities and food safety authorities around the world who gathered for the three- day talks said further tests on different types of food were now urgently needed.</p><blockquote><p>It is likely that this is causing cancer in the human population. It is a genotoxic substance, which means it goes into the genes and changes something, and causes cancer. This is something that people will get in their food all the time, over the whole of their lives</p></blockquote><p>said Dr Schlundt, added that he believed a ‘significant’ proportion of the 30 to 40 per cent of all cancer cases thought to be linked to diet might be caused by acrylamide.</p><blockquote><p>You should not have a picture that if you eat something once that has acrylamide then you will get cancer tomorrow. The longer you eat it, the greater the risk</p></blockquote><p>Early experiments suggest that boiling does not increase levels of the chemical.</p><p>Acrylamide in food appears to be <strong>produced naturally</strong> as a result of <strong>baking or frying</strong>.

Unfortunately, their methods of frying, baking, roasting, and grilling also put the <strong>consumer at risk</strong>. Rapid heating to high temperatures of an amino acid, asparagine (found in all foods) in combination with the common sugars (found in plant-foods), results in the <strong>formation of acrylamide</strong>.</p><p>Most importantly, acrylamide cannot be detected in unheated and boiled foods (100c), because the minimal temperature to cause this conversion (produce acrylamide) is 120c.

Even <strong>without</strong> the acrylamide, these greasy chips <strong>still promote cancer</strong> by other well-known mechanisms, such as excess calories, immune-system suppression from vegetable fats, and cellular damage caused by trans-fats.</p><p>Acrylamide in food is not the result of contamination from environmental sources, but rather from <strong>heating</strong> foods containing sugars (<strong>carbohydrates</strong>). So cooked <strong>organic</strong> foods would not be expected to be any different than levels in cooked foods that are not organic.</p><p>This cancer-causing substance tends to attack the ➜ nervous system ➜ impair fertility ➜ harm genetic material ➜ induce the formation of tumors in experimental animals</p><p>Cancers of the ➜ thyroid gland ➜ female breast tissues ➜ male testicles ➜ mouth are most common</p><p>Because acrylamide causes cancer in laboratory animals in high doses, it is considered a potential human carcinogen.</p><p><strong>WHO</strong> estimates, people consume <strong>1 microgram/Kg</strong> of acrylamide a day, the risk of cancer is about <strong>1 in 1000</strong>. <strong>Stockholm University</strong> research group found <strong>one microgram of acrylamide</strong> in just <strong>0.5gr of potato chips</strong> or <strong>2gr of french fries</strong>. The research group estimates are that <strong>people typically eat an average of 35-40 micrograms per day</strong> of acrylamide.</p><p>In general, there is a <strong>10 times difference</strong> in the amount of acrylamide between <strong>normal</strong> cooked and <strong>overcooked</strong> foods.</p><p><strong>Cooking meat produces no acrylamide</strong>, does not mean meat is off the hook as a health hazard. Cooking meat has been recognized for decades to produce many very <strong>powerful cancer-causing substances</strong> including heterocyclic amines, N-nitroso compounds (nitrosamines) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (benzopyrene).</p><p>Don’t drink coffee since this beverage is made from <strong>roasted beans</strong>. <strong>Tea</strong>, even black tea with caffeine, is made by low-temperature drying processes, not roasting and therefore would have undetectable acrylamide levels.</p><p>Do not <strong>damage</strong> your <strong>foods</strong> by <strong>overheating</strong> them. Foods will always be safe with <strong>boiling</strong> and <strong>steaming</strong>, because the maximum temperature reached is only 100c.</p><p>Keep the foods <strong>below 120c</strong>. When baking breads or casseroles, using <strong>lower temperatures for longer periods</strong> will produce less acrylamide. Removing the <strong>crust</strong> from commercial breads will also <strong>reduce</strong> acrylamide exposure.</p><p>Focus on the fact that our common cancers, breast, prostate, and colon, are <strong>rare in populations</strong> whose diets are based on cooked starches and vegetables, such as the rice-eating <strong>Japanese</strong>. These people, living on their traditional diet, enjoy the world’s record for longevity and also have almost <strong>no</strong> heart disease, type-2 diabetes, or obesity.

Avoiding cigarette smoke can lower your exposure to this and other harmful chemicals.</p><p>Here are some ways to reduce exposure to acrylamide in foods, according to the FDA:</p><p>-Limit foods that might be high in acrylamide, such as potato products (especially French fries and potato chips), coffee, and foods made from <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">grains</span> (such as breakfast cereals, cookies, and toast). -Limit certain cooking methods, such as frying and roasting, and limit the time certain foods are cooked. Boiling and steaming do not produce acrylamide. -Soak raw potato slices in water for 15 to 30 minutes before frying or roasting to reduce acrylamide formation during cooking. (Soaked potatoes should be drained and blotted dry before cooking to prevent splattering or fires.) -If frying potatoes or toasting bread, cook them to a lighter color (as opposed to dark brown), which produces less acrylamide. -Avoid storing potatoes in the refrigerator, which can result in increased acrylamide levels during cooking.</p><ul><li><p>The <a href="https://www.iarc.fr/index.php">International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)</a> classifies acrylamide as a <strong>“probable human carcinogen.”</strong></p><li><p>The <a href="https://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/">US National Toxicology Program (NTP)</a> has classified acrylamide as <strong>“reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen.”</strong></p><li><p>The <a href="https://www.epa.gov/">US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)</a> classifies acrylamide as <strong>“likely to be carcinogenic to humans.”</strong></p></ul><p><strong>Food and Drug Administration</strong> Acrylamide Questions and Answers: www.fda.gov/Food/FoodborneIllnessContaminants/ChemicalContaminants/ucm053569.htm</p><p><strong>National Cancer Institute</strong> Acrylamide and Cancer Risk: www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/diet/acrylamide-fact-sheet</p><p><strong>Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry</strong> ToxFAQs for Acrylamide: www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=1162&amp;tid=236</p><p><strong>European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)</strong> EFSA explains risk assessment: Acrylamide in food: www.efsa.europa.eu/en/corporate/pub/acrylamide150604</p><p>src - <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">2019</span></strong> - https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/acrylamide.html</p><hr /><p>when asked <strong>wasa.de</strong> (delikatess) for the baking temperature, the reply made on 18/02/2020 was :</p><blockquote><p>The Wasa crispbread is baked at temperatures of up to approx. 380 ° C.</p></blockquote><p>when acknowledge this page to <strong>wasa.de</strong>, the reply made on 19/02/2020 was :</p><blockquote><p>In fact, there has been a lot of misinformation and half-truths on the Internet for over 10 years.

When Barilla manufactures and develops crispbread products, these recommendations are taken into account to minimize acrylamide levels. Among other things, it has been shown that the fermentation process has a very positive effect in minimizing the acrylamide content in bread products. The majority of Wasa products have very long fermentation times.
